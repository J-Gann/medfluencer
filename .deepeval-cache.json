Panic seems to come from\\u00a0\\nnowhere. You can't always predict when panic\\u00a0\\u00a0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\u00a0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\u00a0\\u00a0predicting when you're going to feel some anxiety\\u00a0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\u00a0\\u00a0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\u00a0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don't try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\u00a0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\u00a0\\u00a0they actually are and makes your panic or\\u00a0\\nanxiety worse. It's also important to work\\u00a0\\u00a0to decrease over-anxiety.

So treating anxiety is this combination\\u00a0\\u00a0of changing your relationship with anxiety,\\u00a0\\nof accepting anxiety and making space for it,\\u00a0\\u00a0and also putting things in your life in order.\\u00a0\\u00a0So doing that groundwork to resolve your\\u00a0\\nbackground stress, that can make a big difference.Okay.

then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he

someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because

United States\\nfor many years as Surgeon General and as\\nCommissioner of Health for the state of\\nNew York Thou shalt not be a victim Dr\\nnoll's passion for improving the lives\\nof All Families includes a focus on\\nmental health and when you're a Hispanic\\nand you talk about mental\\nillness sometimes we tend to keep things\\nunder the table secret and that's wrong\\nbecause today there is help for everyone\\nand you are not the only one who suffers\\nfrom this in the United States doctors\\nuse medical terms to describe different\\ntypes of mental disorders here are some\\nof the most common\\nanxiety is a normal reaction to fear or\\nstress but when it gets out of control\\nand interferes with a person's life it\\nis called an anxiety disorder anxiety\\ndisorder can take many forms with many\\ndifferent symptoms the signs that uh\\npeople might notice uh uh to identify\\nanxiety and the loved one include uh\\nagitation restlessness feeling of fear\\nor or Doom aches and pains for example\\nmuscle tension uh headaches stomach\\naches know sometimes can even develop\\ninto what are called panic attacks\\nsymptoms of panic attacks or panic\\ndisorder can include a pounding heart\\nsweating weakness dizziness or\\nsmothering Sensations people having a\\npanic attack often fear they are about\\nto be harmed that they are not in\\ncontrol and have a general sense of\\nunreality and you just feel like the\\nworld is closing in on\\nyou Jose C experienced many of those\\nfeelings before he was diagnosed with\\npanic disorder a type of anxiety\\ndisorder my Palms were sweat a lot I'm\\nreally out of control a lot and um I\\nwould I wouldn't um be able to\\ncommunicate more effectively the way I\\nwanted to with my wife as often happens\\nwith mental illness it was the spouse\\nwho called attention to the symptoms\\nJose's wife Maryanne helped him realize\\nthat he needed to seek medical care I I\\nhad to see for myself that a lot of the\\nsigns that my wife was sharing with me\\nwere there and really just could come to\\nterms that you know this is this is\\nsomething that I have to deal with the\\ncauses of anxiety can be wide ranging so\\ncan the symptoms Jose experiences panic\\ndisorder that is just one of many forms\\nanxiety disorder can take another\\nanxiety disorder is called\\npost-traumatic stress disorder or\\nPTSD this can occur when a person is\\nterrified by a situation involving\\nphysical harm or the threat of harm such\\nas combat immigration issues natural\\ndisasters and violence at home or in the\\ncommunity PTSD can be associated with\\nnightmares recurring memories and\\nfeelings of Terror again there are many\\nkinds of anxiety disorder but one common\\ntheme is the relief of recognizing you\\nhave a problem and dealing with it the\\nstory that Jose tells us\\nillustrates a challenge that many\\nLatinos face in seeking treatment in\\nthat uh we Latinos many times men have\\nmultiple roles and responsibilities we\\nhave multiple burdens we put treatment\\noff and conss put it off for years with\\nuh problematic\\nconsequences when I finally got my\\ndiagnosis it sort of put everything in\\n[Music]\\nperspective one reason Jose's wife\\nMaryanne knew he needed help was that\\nshe herself had struggled with a mental\\ndisorder depression my depression it\\nstarted when I was in my teens about 15\\nI was very\\nintroverted um just thinking too much\\ntoo just too much to myself neither\\nMaryanne nor her parents realized what\\nwas wrong it just kind of went untreated\\nfor many many years\\nso used drugs alcohol a lot of different\\nthings to medicate my emotions and my\\nfeelings I didn't learn until later on\\nuh in my later 20s that I had a mental\\nillness depression is a medical\\ncondition um in which people feel\\nextremely depressed and sad for a\\nsustained period of time they could have\\nuh a sense of hopelessness an extreme\\nguilt um even though there's no reason\\nuh for feeling this way people who are\\ndepressed might have an inability\", \"panic attacks are a different beast altogether\\u00a0\\nif you've only ever had one panic attack or just a\\u00a0\\u00a0handful you can try any of these previous\\u00a0\\ntechniques that you want give them a try\\u00a0\\u00a0just experiment see if they work but if you\\u00a0\\nget repeated panic attacks then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he says i once overheard a man in a stall\\u00a0\\nnext to me whispered to himself please not now[Applause]yeah now jimmy makes a great joke of it but\\u00a0\\ni can almost guarantee that it was someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because acceptance has to come\\u00a0\\nbefore change and the technique is a little\\u00a0\\u00a0bit paradoxical so in the next video we're\\u00a0\\ngoing to talk about how the panic cycle works\\u00a0\\u00a0and in the last video we're going to go way in\\u00a0\\ndepth on how to stop recurring panic attacks[Music] you\", \"safety\\ncritical tasks\\nof course removing too

focused on a very\\npractical task\\num does prevent symptoms of panic it\\ndoes prevent the the sort of intrusion\\nof those worrying thoughts\\nand so my advice would be to get an\\noccupational report\\num or do a workplace assessment uh or\\nget corroborating\\neyewitness accounts of of these episodes\\nof panic from other people\\nwhich can help you as the clinician\\nto feel more confident uh to allow\\npeople to sort of re-engage in these\\nsafety critical activities\\nperhaps in a graded or supervised uh\\nmanner at the start so uh\\nsafe working and the final uh\\nheading

Let's jump into\\nthis QuickStart guide to depression.Okay so first, a depression diagnosis does not\\nmean that you are defective. It's notyour fault, you're not broken, and you\\nshould know the disorder is treatable.Depression is a real and challenging\\ncondition that combines biology, lifeexperience, thoughts and actions, to\\ncreate a pattern that's difficult tobreak out of on your own. But, with the\\nright resources and support, things canget way better. So the first thing you\\nshould do is you should see a doctor. Youyou can look into medication options but\\nthat's not the reason I think you shoulddo this first. You should see a doctor\\nbecause depression symptoms can actuallybe caused by a bunch of underlying\\nmedical conditions and you should rulethese out before spending tons of money\\nor effort on therapy and psych meds andother treatments. So, you should get\\ntested for vitamin deficienciesespecially in the area of vitamin D\\nvitamin B's magnesium zinc and iron, andyou should get checked for other common\\ndeficiencies that impact sleep energyand mood. Basically long story short,\\nconsider getting checked because manyphysical disorders actually look and\\nfeel like depression. So you want to makesure that your body's healthy and that\\nthat's not the real cause of yourdepression. Now number two, find a\\ntherapist and or support or educationgroup that can help you find resources\\nexplore causes and solve problems.Therapy literally changes brain\\nchemistry and structure. It's effectivefor up to 85 percent of people who seek\\nhelp. Now, it may take a few tries to finda therapist who you feel comfortable\\nwith and who also helps you stretchlearn and grow. But don't quit if the\\nfirst therapist or first couple ofsessions don't work out. Now just one\\nmoreplug for therapy I've got to say, new\\nresearch is showing that therapyactually changes your blood markers that\\nindicate depression and therapy canchange the physical structures in your\\nbrain that indicate depression. So onestudy showed that people who received\\ntherapy their hypothalamus which hadshrunk during a bout of depression after\\na course of eight weeks of therapy, theirhypothalamus was regaining its original\\nsize. So that's a structure in the brainthat's physically changing because of\\nwhat you think about and what you talkedabout.\\nSo, go find a good therapist and do yourwork that can change your brain\\nchemistry function and structure. Okay sonumber three, add a little movement to\\nyour day. Even if it's just a coupleminutes. In studies exercise has been\\nconsistently shown to be more effectivethan medication at treating depression\\nand it has great side effects you feelgood you lose weight and you get healthy.\\nDon't get overwhelmed just start bygoing for a short walk every day or find\\nsomething else that you enjoy. Numberfour, improve your sleep. Depression and\\ninsomnia are closely linked andimproving sleep has been shown to\\npositively impact depression symptoms.One study showed that eighty seven\\npercent of people who completelyresolved their sleep problems also\\nresolved their depression symptoms.Practice good sleep hygiene if you don't\\nknow what that is I made a video aboutit, turn your screens off one hour before\\nbedtime, make your sleep environment cooldark and quiet and consider cutting out\\ncaffeine from your diet.

Finally, more important than\\nfeeling happy all the time or notfeeling bad is creating a life\\nfull of purpose and meaning. When you dothis, contentment and joy tend to follow.\\nWhen we obsess about how we feel then wetend to feel miserable. Find a cause that\\nmatters to you. Put your values and yourlife in order and work to improve\\nyourself just a little bit each day. Thejourney of a thousand miles begins with\\none step. If you only improve one percenteach day then by the end of the year\\nyou'll have grown immensely. Okay lastly,know your treatment options.\", \"So it really is different.We need to know that data to \\ntailor the solutions.So I hope that answered some of\\nyour questions.\\u226b I think maybe even going back\\na decade, you can imagine the two of us\\nhaving the conversation  in this building,but the APA has prioritize \\ncollaborative care and working with primary care doctors.  So \\none of the things and solution is thatwe know perinatal mood and \\nanxiety disorders contribute tonegative outcomes. So tell me \\nhow you have been collaborating with \\npsychiatrists in orderto make sure they're \\ncomfortable , not only recognizing when those \\ndisorders are happening, but treating them through  their \\npregnancy? \\u226b Is a collaborative \\npartnership and depending uponthe psychiatrist, how \\ncomfortable they are in caring for  a pregnant person, the \\npartnership  will vary.I've unfortunately had more \\npersonal experience with psychiatrists taking \\npatients off medication immediately because they were \\npregnant. When a patient maybe had been on  an antidepressant \\nfor years.So I would realize that and say\\nwhy did you stop your medicine?They said my psychiatrist said \\nto stop the medication. So again, is this cross \\ncollaborative-- it's educating the \\npsychiatrists on, it's okay, and the psychiatry \\nclinicians, it's okay to be on medication you look at the \\nrisk benefits. But then at the same time, her obstetricianclinicians to say it's okay to \\nstart somebody on medication because they need it. What you \\nneed that collaborative partnership.And we have to remember that. I\\nsay this often. 80% of health happens outside of the  health \\ncare setting. So maybe they're going to spend 10, 15 minuteswith her OB.That's how long I  was spending\\nwhen I was in the clinic.But the reality is that most of\\nthe care is going to be happening  outside of the \\nofficeand so I would hope they fill \\ntheir medication, if there was when given,  because you know \\nthat 25% people don't  fill theprescription.To be able to have a resource ,\\nwhether it's to the churches orschools , mom to mom support \\ngroups.A lot of cross collaboration is\\nneeded. \\u226b We have mentioned that we are\\nin collaboration  a lot.We definitely think that's \\nimportant and  we emphasize it.But collaboration has to happenwhen you can have a \\npsychiatrist  and you have an OB dock.Oftentimes, he will don't have \\neither or they  don't have access, timely access to culturally responsible  for \\nculturally responsive mental health professional. How do we \\nmake that happen? How do we expand our reach so that \\npatients and to get the care atthe  right time, from the right\\nprovider? \\u226b I asked that exact same \\nquestion to a group of leaders I convened in April from \\nCalifornia. It was a cross collaborative group from \\nphysiciansto business people, to  I.T. \\npeople.Voices from the community . \\nAfrican-American, American Indian, Hispanic, Asian.I asked them, how can we \\nimprove  the care?We came up with three \\ninitiatives,and they are, one, to be able \\nto the risk of  a patient in the health care settingas soon as they are admitted or\\nin the health care setting. Because we know that 80% of \\nthe deaths are preventable. So if we can identify them early \\non, that  would be fantastic.The other is to empowerand to enable a pregnant person\\nto know the riskbefore they become pregnant \\nright now,  what's happening isthat people don't know the risk of complicationsuntil they are already pregnant\\nor in  the hospital in a situation where you can't do anything but if you \\nare to know beforehand, right, what your trajectory \\ncould be, you can start to makea difference. The third was \\ntrust.So going with trust.Really, it was the American \\nIndian and Black voices in the room that said, we really needto make amends for all of the \\nhistorical harm that  has been -- that has occurred throughout\\nthe ages.More importantly, COVID has \\nalso brought in some mistrust.So using our trusted voices,whether those are community \\nhealth workers, whether they are doulas, whether they are [ \\nSpeaking Non-English ] to be the voice to say, this  is the \\ninformation. It is okay and I encourage you to get the care \\nyou need to help support and be that source of \\ninformation for our patients  isso critically important. \\n\\u226b I agree.I think we really talk about \\nthe impact of education and \\nempowerment and education .\", \"We have a\\u00a0\\u00a0tendency to self-diagnose, to label ourselves, and\\u00a0\\nto take suggestions as if they're fact. But just\\u00a0\\u00a0because you sympathize with the list of symptoms\\u00a0\\ndoesn't mean you actually have that disorder.Now, I've heard this lecture at the\\u00a0\\nbeginning of most of my psych classes,\\u00a0\\u00a0so a couple dozen classes. But even into\\u00a0\\ngrad school, and even with that knowledge,\\u00a0\\u00a0it was easy for me when I took a\\u00a0\\ndiagnosing class in grad school\\u00a0\\u00a0to start seeing myself in every diagnosis. We\\u00a0\\nhave a tendency to diagnose ourselves inaccurately\\u00a0\\u00a0because we don't have the context to see\\u00a0\\nthat it's common to over-diagnose yourself.And because people are diagnosing themselves\\u00a0\\nonline, out of context, without the support of\\u00a0\\u00a0a licensed professional who can walk them through\\u00a0\\nthe steps of treatment, then some people just feel\\u00a0\\u00a0hopeless or broken - when in reality they may\\u00a0\\nnot even have the disorder, or if they do,\\u00a0\\u00a0there's tons of treatment options.So self-diagnosis should help you to\\u00a0\\nreach out to a mental health provider\\u00a0\\u00a0to get the skills and treatment needed. But when\\u00a0\\nso many people can't get access to good resources,\\u00a0\\u00a0we get caught up in this huge wave of\\u00a0\\nincreasing anxiety and depression rates\\u00a0\\u00a0because people are either over-diagnosing\\u00a0\\nthemselves or diagnosing themselves\\u00a0\\u00a0without the context of support\\u00a0\\nand treatment and education.So for example, if someone were just to do a\\u00a0\\nquick, cursory search of the internet and be like,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Oh yeah, look, I have depression\\\" and then\\u00a0\\nthey were to look very quickly to see, \\\"Oh,\\u00a0\\u00a0what causes depression and what are\\u00a0\\nthe treatments?\\\" they might see an\\u00a0\\u00a0overly simplified explanation that depression is a\\u00a0\\nbiological illness caused by a chemical imbalance,and the only treatment is medication. Now, biology\\u00a0\\ndoes contribute to depression, but it's way more\\u00a0\\u00a0complicated than that. And medication is not the\\u00a0\\nonly treatment option. Medication is a perfectly\\u00a0\\u00a0fine treatment option, but there's so many\\u00a0\\ntreatment options. So without the context of,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, well-rounded professional expertise,\\u00a0\\npretty hard to get high-quality information.Okay. Another way you can see this is\\u00a0\\nthat psychology has had these really\\u00a0\\u00a0interesting trends. The more a disorder is\\u00a0\\ntalked about it, the more people have it.\\u00a0\\u00a0In the nineties, ADHD was starting to be described\\u00a0\\nwith more clarity, and more people were talking\\u00a0\\u00a0about it. More and more medications to\\u00a0\\ntreat it were developed and advertised.Then you can see that the rates of ADHD\\u00a0\\ndoubled from 1997 to 2017, going from around 5%\\u00a0\\u00a0to around 10% of kids. Now, it's not possible to\\u00a0\\ntell whether this increase represents a change\\u00a0\\u00a0in the number of children who have ADHD\\u00a0\\nor a change in the number of children who\\u00a0\\u00a0were diagnosed. Seeing an increase\\u00a0\\nin diagnosis could be a good thing.It means that more kids are getting resources\\u00a0\\nat school or medication or other treatments.\\u00a0\\u00a0But it also means that kids who are diagnosed\\u00a0\\nby their parents or neighbor or teacher as\\u00a0\\u00a0being ADD, it might be a false label. It might\\u00a0\\nbe something that changes how they see themselves\\u00a0\\u00a0or how others see them. They might feel broken\\u00a0\\nor defective or incapable of doing schoolwork\\u00a0\\u00a0because that label could be inaccurate.\\u00a0\\u00a0Or maybe they do have ADD, and the diagnosis\\u00a0\\ncomes without treatment or support.Now, one of the reasons that we have increasing\\u00a0\\nrates of some of these things is because we do\\u00a0\\u00a0have better resources available: better\\u00a0\\nmedication, better diagnostic tools,\\u00a0\\u00a0more early intervention. So for example,\\u00a0\\nautism is being talked about more than ever.\\u00a0\\u00a0And pediatricians all across the country are\\u00a0\\nscreening two- and three-year-olds for autism.And if they have symptoms, then they'll try\\u00a0\\nto enroll them in early intervention programs.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, 40 years ago, most kids wouldn't be getting\\u00a0\\na diagnosis or much support. So I'm not saying\\u00a0\\u00a0that these issues aren't real. It's just that\\u00a0\\npeople also have a tendency to self-diagnose\\u00a0\\u00a0and to diagnose others. The more we talk about\\u00a0\\na disorder, the more people self-diagnose.And pharmaceutical companies don't help with\\u00a0\\ntheir ads. Many people self-diagnose after\\u00a0\\u00a0watching a medication commercial and then believe\\u00a0\\nthat medication is the only treatment option for\\u00a0\\u00a0depression or ADHD. And like I said, it's a fine\\u00a0\\noption, but it's just one of them.

So maybe they're going to spend 10, 15 minuteswith her OB.That's how long I  was spending\\nwhen I was in the clinic.But the reality is that most of\\nthe care is going to be happening  outside of the \\nofficeand so I would hope they fill \\ntheir medication, if there was when given,  because you know \\nthat 25% people don't  fill theprescription.To be able to have a resource ,\\nwhether it's to the churches orschools , mom to mom support \\ngroups.A lot of cross collaboration is\\nneeded. \\u226b We have mentioned that we are\\nin collaboration  a lot.We definitely think that's \\nimportant and  we emphasize it.But collaboration has to happenwhen you can have a \\npsychiatrist  and you have an OB dock.Oftentimes, he will don't have \\neither or they  don't have access, timely access to culturally responsible  for \\nculturally responsive mental health professional. How do we \\nmake that happen? How do we expand our reach so that \\npatients and to get the care atthe  right time, from the right\\nprovider? \\u226b I asked that exact same \\nquestion to a group of leaders I convened in April from \\nCalifornia. It was a cross collaborative group from \\nphysiciansto business people, to  I.T. \\npeople.Voices from the community . \\nAfrican-American, American Indian, Hispanic, Asian.I asked them, how can we \\nimprove  the care?We came up with three \\ninitiatives,and they are, one, to be able \\nto the risk of  a patient in the health care settingas soon as they are admitted or\\nin the health care setting. Because we know that 80% of \\nthe deaths are preventable. So if we can identify them early \\non, that  would be fantastic.The other is to empowerand to enable a pregnant person\\nto know the riskbefore they become pregnant \\nright now,  what's happening isthat people don't know the risk of complicationsuntil they are already pregnant\\nor in  the hospital in a situation where you can't do anything but if you \\nare to know beforehand, right, what your trajectory \\ncould be, you can start to makea difference. The third was \\ntrust.So going with trust.Really, it was the American \\nIndian and Black voices in the room that said, we really needto make amends for all of the \\nhistorical harm that  has been -- that has occurred throughout\\nthe ages.More importantly, COVID has \\nalso brought in some mistrust.So using our trusted voices,whether those are community \\nhealth workers, whether they are doulas, whether they are [ \\nSpeaking Non-English ] to be the voice to say, this  is the \\ninformation. It is okay and I encourage you to get the care \\nyou need to help support and be that source of \\ninformation for our patients  isso critically important. \\n\\u226b I agree.I think we really talk about \\nthe impact of education and \\nempowerment and education .\", \"We have a\\u00a0\\u00a0tendency to self-diagnose, to label ourselves, and\\u00a0\\nto take suggestions as if they're fact. But just\\u00a0\\u00a0because you sympathize with the list of symptoms\\u00a0\\ndoesn't mean you actually have that disorder.Now, I've heard this lecture at the\\u00a0\\nbeginning of most of my psych classes,\\u00a0\\u00a0so a couple dozen classes. But even into\\u00a0\\ngrad school, and even with that knowledge,\\u00a0\\u00a0it was easy for me when I took a\\u00a0\\ndiagnosing class in grad school\\u00a0\\u00a0to start seeing myself in every diagnosis. We\\u00a0\\nhave a tendency to diagnose ourselves inaccurately\\u00a0\\u00a0because we don't have the context to see\\u00a0\\nthat it's common to over-diagnose yourself.And because people are diagnosing themselves\\u00a0\\nonline, out of context, without the support of\\u00a0\\u00a0a licensed professional who can walk them through\\u00a0\\nthe steps of treatment, then some people just feel\\u00a0\\u00a0hopeless or broken - when in reality they may\\u00a0\\nnot even have the disorder, or if they do,\\u00a0\\u00a0there's tons of treatment options.So self-diagnosis should help you to\\u00a0\\nreach out to a mental health provider\\u00a0\\u00a0to get the skills and treatment needed. But when\\u00a0\\nso many people can't get access to good resources,\\u00a0\\u00a0we get caught up in this huge wave of\\u00a0\\nincreasing anxiety and depression rates\\u00a0\\u00a0because people are either over-diagnosing\\u00a0\\nthemselves or diagnosing themselves\\u00a0\\u00a0without the context of support\\u00a0\\nand treatment and education.So for example, if someone were just to do a\\u00a0\\nquick, cursory search of the internet and be like,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Oh yeah, look, I have depression\\\" and then\\u00a0\\nthey were to look very quickly to see, \\\"Oh,\\u00a0\\u00a0what causes depression and what are\\u00a0\\nthe treatments?\\\" they might see an\\u00a0\\u00a0overly simplified explanation that depression is a\\u00a0\\nbiological illness caused by a chemical imbalance,and the only treatment is medication. Now, biology\\u00a0\\ndoes contribute to depression, but it's way more\\u00a0\\u00a0complicated than that. And medication is not the\\u00a0\\nonly treatment option. Medication is a perfectly\\u00a0\\u00a0fine treatment option, but there's so many\\u00a0\\ntreatment options. So without the context of,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, well-rounded professional expertise,\\u00a0\\npretty hard to get high-quality information.Okay. Another way you can see this is\\u00a0\\nthat psychology has had these really\\u00a0\\u00a0interesting trends. The more a disorder is\\u00a0\\ntalked about it, the more people have it.\\u00a0\\u00a0In the nineties, ADHD was starting to be described\\u00a0\\nwith more clarity, and more people were talking\\u00a0\\u00a0about it. More and more medications to\\u00a0\\ntreat it were developed and advertised.Then you can see that the rates of ADHD\\u00a0\\ndoubled from 1997 to 2017, going from around 5%\\u00a0\\u00a0to around 10% of kids. Now, it's not possible to\\u00a0\\ntell whether this increase represents a change\\u00a0\\u00a0in the number of children who have ADHD\\u00a0\\nor a change in the number of children who\\u00a0\\u00a0were diagnosed. Seeing an increase\\u00a0\\nin diagnosis could be a good thing.It means that more kids are getting resources\\u00a0\\nat school or medication or other treatments.\\u00a0\\u00a0But it also means that kids who are diagnosed\\u00a0\\nby their parents or neighbor or teacher as\\u00a0\\u00a0being ADD, it might be a false label. It might\\u00a0\\nbe something that changes how they see themselves\\u00a0\\u00a0or how others see them. They might feel broken\\u00a0\\nor defective or incapable of doing schoolwork\\u00a0\\u00a0because that label could be inaccurate.\\u00a0\\u00a0Or maybe they do have ADD, and the diagnosis\\u00a0\\ncomes without treatment or support.Now, one of the reasons that we have increasing\\u00a0\\nrates of some of these things is because we do\\u00a0\\u00a0have better resources available: better\\u00a0\\nmedication, better diagnostic tools,\\u00a0\\u00a0more early intervention. So for example,\\u00a0\\nautism is being talked about more than ever.\\u00a0\\u00a0And pediatricians all across the country are\\u00a0\\nscreening two- and three-year-olds for autism.And if they have symptoms, then they'll try\\u00a0\\nto enroll them in early intervention programs.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, 40 years ago, most kids wouldn't be getting\\u00a0\\na diagnosis or much support. So I'm not saying\\u00a0\\u00a0that these issues aren't real. It's just that\\u00a0\\npeople also have a tendency to self-diagnose\\u00a0\\u00a0and to diagnose others. The more we talk about\\u00a0\\na disorder, the more people self-diagnose.And pharmaceutical companies don't help with\\u00a0\\ntheir ads. Many people self-diagnose after\\u00a0\\u00a0watching a medication commercial and then believe\\u00a0\\nthat medication is the only treatment option for\\u00a0\\u00a0depression or ADHD. And like I said, it's a fine\\u00a0\\noption, but it's just one of them. It's just one\\u00a0\\u00a0of many options.\", \"[Music]\\n[Music]\\nhi my name is jessie wolf social work\\nmayo clinic health system so i chose\\nsocial work because there's a wide range\\nof opportunities to be able to\\ninteract with patients families and help\\nthem achieve their goals whether it's in\\nhealth care\\nchild protection or other areas there's\\njust a lot of opportunity to help i\\nenjoy most is the opportunity to see\\npatients reach their goals whether it's\\ntheir healthcare goals mental health\\ngoals or future goals that they've set\\nfor themselves and they're not quite\\nsure where to go with them\\nit's really fun to see that change in\\ngrowth so areas of interest for me is\\nworking with individuals\\nwho are wondering if they have adhd so i\\nexplored and earned\\nsome certification in being able to\\nassess and treat individuals with that\\ndiagnosis other areas of interest for me\\nreally is partnering with our medical\\nteam to help support\\nfolks with chronic illness\\ndepression anxiety grief loss and\\nadjustment to significant life changes\\nso what i like best about working for\\nmayo is the collaboration that can\\nhappen so as a clinical social worker i\\nprovide diagnostic assessments in\\npsychotherapy to help people meet their\\nmental health and medical goals\\nand a part of that is partnering with\\nour psychiatry team to ensure that we're\\non the right medication or even our\\npharmacist so there's some\\nlab tests that we need to ensure that\\nwe're on the right medication\\nas well as our medical team members on\\nthe medic the medical diagnosis and how\\ndoes that affect our mental health as\\nwell\\nso that collaboration is a huge piece in\\nwhat we do and what i enjoy about my\\nwork my name is jessie wolf social work\\nmayo clinic health system\\n[Music]\\n[Applause]\\n[Music]\\nyou\", \"position are you\\ntaking are you going to be there when\\nit's discussed a good MP is going to\\nrespond to that as psychiatrists who are\\ndoctors we want to see how patients have\\nhave exactly the same rights as every\\nother ordinary Citizen and not be\\ndiscriminated against this issue is\\nabout the Mental Health Community\\ngetting together to tackle stigma and\\ndiscrimination we believe it's got the\\npotential to be a watershed moment in\\nthe way in which people with mental\\nhealth issues experience stigma and\\ndiscrimination this is worth fighting\\nfor\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 0.9375, "reason": "The score is 0.94 because while most of the response is relevant to the signs and treatment of depression, there is one statement that does not provide relevant information about the signs and treatment of depression.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "evaluationCost": 0}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.7, "evaluation_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}, {"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Faithfulness", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "Great job!

Okay, so then let's just\\u00a0\\u00a0talk specifically about agoraphobia. So when we\\u00a0\\nhave a phobia, when we're afraid of a specific\\u00a0\\u00a0thing, um like leaving the house, or when\\u00a0\\nwe are afraid of - with health anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0we're afraid of um like what if something's the\\u00a0\\nmatter? What if I am sick and I don't know it?\\u00a0\\u00a0What if this symptom is a sign that I have this\\u00a0\\nterrible disease, right? And then with social\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety the fear is like \\\"Oh, what if people are\\u00a0\\njudging me? What if I mess up? What if Ii blush?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0So then the thing we do that makes it\\u00a0\\nworse is we try to make it go away.\\u00a0\\u00a0We try not to feel anxious. We try to force\\u00a0\\nourselves to not feel social anxiety. Or\\u00a0\\u00a0we obsess about that disorder like \\\"Oh what\\u00a0\\nwhat is this symptom going on inside of me?\\u00a0\\u00a0And um so like like someone with health anxiety,\\u00a0\\nthey're gonna obsess about this symptom. Like \\\"Oh,\\u00a0\\u00a0my stomach hurts; does that mean I have this\\u00a0\\nxyz horrible disease?\\\" Right? With agoraphobia\\u00a0\\u00a0people are gonna worry about like \\\"What if I\\u00a0\\ngo outside and feel anxious? What if I leave my\\u00a0\\u00a0house and feel anxious? This could be horrible;\\u00a0\\nthis could be catastrophizing - uh this could\\u00a0\\u00a0be a catastrophe.\\\" So with agoraphobia, when you\\u00a0\\navoid going outside or when you make these rules\\u00a0\\u00a0where you're trying to control the anxiety,\\u00a0\\nyou're trying to say \\\"I can only go outside\\u00a0\\u00a0if I don't feel anxious,\\\" then that basically\\u00a0\\ntells your brain that anxiety is dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the new problem is not going outside, but\\u00a0\\nthe new problem is your brain has determined that\\u00a0\\u00a0you - like now anxiety is the real danger, and\\u00a0\\nI need to avoid anxiety by not doing things that\\u00a0\\u00a0are scary. And then that tells your brain to make\\u00a0\\nyourself more anxious about that situation, and um\\u00a0\\u00a0then you feel more anxiety about it.\\u00a0\\nAnd it creates this spiral, this cycle.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you - so the first thing with all three\\u00a0\\nof those - social anxiety, agoraphobia,\\u00a0\\u00a0health anxieties - look for how are you\\u00a0\\ntrying to control the anxiety? Or how are\\u00a0\\u00a0you trying to avoid the anxiety? And that\\u00a0\\nbasically puts you into a power struggle\\u00a0\\u00a0with - um it puts you into a power struggle with\\u00a0\\nyour anxiety. And the way fear works - anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0is a type of fear - the way fear works is the\\u00a0\\nmore you fight it, the more power it has. So\\u00a0\\u00a0to drop that struggle, there are two\\u00a0\\nimportant steps. And this is big picture,\\u00a0\\u00a0right? Big picture, two important steps: choose\\u00a0\\nsomething that's more important to you than\\u00a0\\u00a0the anxiety. Like right now your whole life has\\u00a0\\nbecome about anxiety. You're not leaving your\\u00a0\\u00a0house because you don't want to feel anxious. You\\u00a0\\nare obsessively checking the internet about your\\u00a0\\u00a0health because you don't want to feel worried that\\u00a0\\nsomething's the matter with you. You avoid social\\u00a0\\u00a0situations because you're afraid you might feel\\u00a0\\nanxious in a social situation, right? Your whole\\u00a0\\u00a0life has become sucked into like trying not to\\u00a0\\nfeel anxious, and that is making you more anxious.\\u00a0\\u00a0So choose something more important to you. What's\\u00a0\\nmore important than anxiety? Is it that you care\\u00a0\\u00a0about people? Is it that you want to connect with\\u00a0\\npeople? Is it that you have kids that you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0be giving your attention to instead of spending\\u00a0\\nhours on the internet looking up symptoms?\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? So the first step with anxiety is saying\\u00a0\\n\\\"Okay, I have been focusing so much on trying\\u00a0\\u00a0to control my anxiety that I've lost track\\u00a0\\nof my life, like I don't know what my life\\u00a0\\u00a0is about anymore. It's only about avoiding\\u00a0\\nanxiety, which is making me very anxious.\\u00a0\\u00a0So values, values, values, right? This is\\u00a0\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy. But it's\\u00a0\\u00a0like, what's more important to you? Why are you\\u00a0\\nwilling to feel some anxiety?\", \"Of course,\\u00a0\\nthat doesn't mean there aren't indirect effects\\u00a0\\u00a0associated with anxiety. So over time, for\\u00a0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\u00a0\\u00a0and chronic stress is associated with a\\u00a0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\u00a0\\u00a0but here's the thing, the key insight about\\u00a0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\u00a0\\u00a0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\u00a0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\u00a0\\u00a0this only makes you more anxious because you're\\u00a0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\u00a0\\u00a0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\u00a0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\u00a0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\u00a0\\u00a0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\u00a0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\u00a0\\u00a0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\u00a0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0Here's the problem with coping skills: they\\u00a0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\u00a0\\u00a0long-term suffering. For example, let's say\\u00a0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\u00a0\\u00a0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\u00a0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, that might help distract you from the\\u00a0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\u00a0\\u00a0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\u00a0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\u00a0\\u00a0you're teaching your brain that it's not okay\\u00a0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\u00a0\\u00a0that the next time you feel anxious you're going\\u00a0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\u00a0\\u00a0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\u00a0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\u00a0\\u00a0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn't\\u00a0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\u00a0\\u00a0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\u00a0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\u00a0\\u00a0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\u00a0\\nYou're training your brain to fear fear itself,\\u00a0\\u00a0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\u00a0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\u00a0\\u00a0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\u00a0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\u00a0\\u00a0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\u00a0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\u00a0\\u00a0afraid. Or maybe you watched someone else who was\\u00a0\\nnervous and afraid being shamed by someone for it,\\u00a0\\u00a0like one parent who is constantly mocked or\\u00a0\\ncriticized for their timidness or fear by the\\u00a0\\u00a0other parent. Whatever the origins of this belief,\\u00a0\\nit can be a surprisingly hard thing to shake,\\u00a0\\u00a0because while many people can acknowledge\\u00a0\\nintellectually that feeling anxious isn't\\u00a0\\u00a0actually a sign of weakness, they still feel that\\u00a0\\nway experientially, especially in the moment.\\u00a0\\u00a0So for example, let's say you just gave a big\\u00a0\\npresentation at work but you got really anxious\\u00a0\\u00a0at one point during the presentation,\\u00a0\\nand you mixed up some key information\\u00a0\\u00a0as a result. You spend the rest of the\\u00a0\\nday ruminating and worrying about it,\\u00a0\\u00a0saying things to yourself like, \\\"That was\\u00a0\\nreally stupid that I mixed those clients up\\u00a0\\u00a0and I got so muddled about it. I can't believe I\\u00a0\\ngot so flustered. Why can't I be more confident\\u00a0\\u00a0like the rest of them? I'm sure now that they\\u00a0\\nthink I'm unreliable because this is the second\\u00a0\\u00a0time in a week that I've gotten visibly frustrated\\u00a0\\nand anxious in front of the team.\\\" So even though\\u00a0\\u00a0intellectually you wouldn't say, probably, that\\u00a0\\nanxiety is a sign of weakness, your self-talk\\u00a0\\u00a0suggests that in the moment you feel otherwise.\\u00a0\\nAnd if that's how you respond to anxiety, with\\u00a0\\u00a0tons of worry and negative self-talk, that's what\\u00a0\\nyour brain is going to continue to believe - that\\u00a0\\u00a0having anxiety is a weakness. Myth number five:\\u00a0\\nanxiety is just something you're born with.\\u00a0\\u00a0One of the most common things I hear from\\u00a0\\npeople who want to be less anxious is that\\u00a0\\u00a0they're afraid it will never change because that's\\u00a0\\njust who they are. So they often say things like,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, \\\"I want to be less anxious, but maybe\\u00a0\\nthat's just how I'm wired,\\\" or \\\"My grandmother\\u00a0\\u00a0was anxious; my mom was anxious; maybe I'm just\\u00a0\\nborn anxious too.\\\" Or my personal favorite:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"I've always been an anxious person.\", \"So\\u00a0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0and while there is always the chance that the\\u00a0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\u00a0\\u00a0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\u00a0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\u00a0\\u00a0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\u00a0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\u00a0\\u00a0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\u00a0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\u00a0\\u00a0then you need to spend some time figuring\\u00a0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\u00a0\\u00a0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\u00a0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\u00a0\\u00a0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\u00a0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\u00a0\\u00a0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\u00a0\\nIs it kindness?

So there's five skills for\\u00a0\\nworking with anxiety about anxiety. Number one:\\u00a0\\u00a0remember anxiety is a feeling; it won't harm\\u00a0\\nyou. Make space for anxiety, acknowledge your\\u00a0\\u00a0sensations, and shift your attention outside as\\u00a0\\nwell. And five: uh clarify what you can and can't\\u00a0\\u00a0control. Okay. Making space for anxiety instead\\u00a0\\nof resisting it and fearing it is a practical step\\u00a0\\u00a0that you can choose to take. It's an action that\\u00a0\\nyou can practice until you get really good at it,\\u00a0\\u00a0and when you do, it opens you up to shift your\\u00a0\\nfocus from anxiety to the things you really care\\u00a0\\u00a0about, whether it's the people around you, the\\u00a0\\npresentation you need to give, or just being\\u00a0\\u00a0a kind and connected human. Okay. Thank you for\\u00a0\\nwatching, thanks for being here, and take care.[Music]\"], \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Was kann ich tun, um besser mit meiner Angstst\\u00f6rung umzugehen?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"As\\u00a0\\nalways, okay, so we start with that baseline.\\u00a0\\u00a0If we're working to treat anxiety, start with that\\u00a0\\nbaseline of taking care of your body and trying to\\u00a0\\u00a0get your body healthy, trying to get enough\\u00a0\\nsleep, trying to get enough light exposure,\\u00a0\\u00a0trying to have health in other areas of your life\\u00a0\\nlike your social life. Okay, so then let's just\\u00a0\\u00a0talk specifically about agoraphobia. So when we\\u00a0\\nhave a phobia, when we're afraid of a specific\\u00a0\\u00a0thing, um like leaving the house, or when\\u00a0\\nwe are afraid of - with health anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0we're afraid of um like what if something's the\\u00a0\\nmatter? What if I am sick and I don't know it?\\u00a0\\u00a0What if this symptom is a sign that I have this\\u00a0\\nterrible disease, right? And then with social\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety the fear is like \\\"Oh, what if people are\\u00a0\\njudging me? What if I mess up? What if Ii blush?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0So then the thing we do that makes it\\u00a0\\nworse is we try to make it go away.\\u00a0\\u00a0We try not to feel anxious. We try to force\\u00a0\\nourselves to not feel social anxiety. Or\\u00a0\\u00a0we obsess about that disorder like \\\"Oh what\\u00a0\\nwhat is this symptom going on inside of me?\\u00a0\\u00a0And um so like like someone with health anxiety,\\u00a0\\nthey're gonna obsess about this symptom. Like \\\"Oh,\\u00a0\\u00a0my stomach hurts; does that mean I have this\\u00a0\\nxyz horrible disease?\\\" Right? With agoraphobia\\u00a0\\u00a0people are gonna worry about like \\\"What if I\\u00a0\\ngo outside and feel anxious? What if I leave my\\u00a0\\u00a0house and feel anxious? This could be horrible;\\u00a0\\nthis could be catastrophizing - uh this could\\u00a0\\u00a0be a catastrophe.\\\" So with agoraphobia, when you\\u00a0\\navoid going outside or when you make these rules\\u00a0\\u00a0where you're trying to control the anxiety,\\u00a0\\nyou're trying to say \\\"I can only go outside\\u00a0\\u00a0if I don't feel anxious,\\\" then that basically\\u00a0\\ntells your brain that anxiety is dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the new problem is not going outside, but\\u00a0\\nthe new problem is your brain has determined that\\u00a0\\u00a0you - like now anxiety is the real danger, and\\u00a0\\nI need to avoid anxiety by not doing things that\\u00a0\\u00a0are scary. And then that tells your brain to make\\u00a0\\nyourself more anxious about that situation, and um\\u00a0\\u00a0then you feel more anxiety about it.\\u00a0\\nAnd it creates this spiral, this cycle.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you - so the first thing with all three\\u00a0\\nof those - social anxiety, agoraphobia,\\u00a0\\u00a0health anxieties - look for how are you\\u00a0\\ntrying to control the anxiety? Or how are\\u00a0\\u00a0you trying to avoid the anxiety? And that\\u00a0\\nbasically puts you into a power struggle\\u00a0\\u00a0with - um it puts you into a power struggle with\\u00a0\\nyour anxiety. And the way fear works - anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0is a type of fear - the way fear works is the\\u00a0\\nmore you fight it, the more power it has. So\\u00a0\\u00a0to drop that struggle, there are two\\u00a0\\nimportant steps. And this is big picture,\\u00a0\\u00a0right? Big picture, two important steps: choose\\u00a0\\nsomething that's more important to you than\\u00a0\\u00a0the anxiety. Like right now your whole life has\\u00a0\\nbecome about anxiety. You're not leaving your\\u00a0\\u00a0house because you don't want to feel anxious. You\\u00a0\\nare obsessively checking the internet about your\\u00a0\\u00a0health because you don't want to feel worried that\\u00a0\\nsomething's the matter with you. You avoid social\\u00a0\\u00a0situations because you're afraid you might feel\\u00a0\\nanxious in a social situation, right? Your whole\\u00a0\\u00a0life has become sucked into like trying not to\\u00a0\\nfeel anxious, and that is making you more anxious.\\u00a0\\u00a0So choose something more important to you. What's\\u00a0\\nmore important than anxiety? Is it that you care\\u00a0\\u00a0about people? Is it that you want to connect with\\u00a0\\npeople? Is it that you have kids that you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0be giving your attention to instead of spending\\u00a0\\nhours on the internet looking up symptoms?\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? So the first step with anxiety is saying\\u00a0\\n\\\"Okay, I have been focusing so much on trying\\u00a0\\u00a0to control my anxiety that I've lost track\\u00a0\\nof my life, like I don't know what my life\\u00a0\\u00a0is about anymore. It's only about avoiding\\u00a0\\nanxiety, which is making me very anxious.\\u00a0\\u00a0So values, values, values, right? This is\\u00a0\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy. But it's\\u00a0\\u00a0like, what's more important to you? Why are you\\u00a0\\nwilling to feel some anxiety?\", \"Of course,\\u00a0\\nthat doesn't mean there aren't indirect effects\\u00a0\\u00a0associated with anxiety. So over time, for\\u00a0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\u00a0\\u00a0and chronic stress is associated with a\\u00a0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\u00a0\\u00a0but here's the thing, the key insight about\\u00a0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\u00a0\\u00a0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\u00a0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\u00a0\\u00a0this only makes you more anxious because you're\\u00a0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\u00a0\\u00a0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\u00a0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\u00a0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\u00a0\\u00a0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\u00a0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\u00a0\\u00a0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\u00a0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0Here's the problem with coping skills: they\\u00a0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\u00a0\\u00a0long-term suffering. For example, let's say\\u00a0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\u00a0\\u00a0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\u00a0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, that might help distract you from the\\u00a0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\u00a0\\u00a0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\u00a0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\u00a0\\u00a0you're teaching your brain that it's not okay\\u00a0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\u00a0\\u00a0that the next time you feel anxious you're going\\u00a0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\u00a0\\u00a0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\u00a0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\u00a0\\u00a0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn't\\u00a0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\u00a0\\u00a0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\u00a0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\u00a0\\u00a0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\u00a0\\nYou're training your brain to fear fear itself,\\u00a0\\u00a0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\u00a0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\u00a0\\u00a0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\u00a0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\u00a0\\u00a0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\u00a0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\u00a0\\u00a0afraid. Or maybe you watched someone else who was\\u00a0\\nnervous and afraid being shamed by someone for it,\\u00a0\\u00a0like one parent who is constantly mocked or\\u00a0\\ncriticized for their timidness or fear by the\\u00a0\\u00a0other parent. Whatever the origins of this belief,\\u00a0\\nit can be a surprisingly hard thing to shake,\\u00a0\\u00a0because while many people can acknowledge\\u00a0\\nintellectually that feeling anxious isn't\\u00a0\\u00a0actually a sign of weakness, they still feel that\\u00a0\\nway experientially, especially in the moment.\\u00a0\\u00a0So for example, let's say you just gave a big\\u00a0\\npresentation at work but you got really anxious\\u00a0\\u00a0at one point during the presentation,\\u00a0\\nand you mixed up some key information\\u00a0\\u00a0as a result. You spend the rest of the\\u00a0\\nday ruminating and worrying about it,\\u00a0\\u00a0saying things to yourself like, \\\"That was\\u00a0\\nreally stupid that I mixed those clients up\\u00a0\\u00a0and I got so muddled about it. I can't believe I\\u00a0\\ngot so flustered. Why can't I be more confident\\u00a0\\u00a0like the rest of them? I'm sure now that they\\u00a0\\nthink I'm unreliable because this is the second\\u00a0\\u00a0time in a week that I've gotten visibly frustrated\\u00a0\\nand anxious in front of the team.\\\" So even though\\u00a0\\u00a0intellectually you wouldn't say, probably, that\\u00a0\\nanxiety is a sign of weakness, your self-talk\\u00a0\\u00a0suggests that in the moment you feel otherwise.\\u00a0\\nAnd if that's how you respond to anxiety, with\\u00a0\\u00a0tons of worry and negative self-talk, that's what\\u00a0\\nyour brain is going to continue to believe - that\\u00a0\\u00a0having anxiety is a weakness. Myth number five:\\u00a0\\nanxiety is just something you're born with.\\u00a0\\u00a0One of the most common things I hear from\\u00a0\\npeople who want to be less anxious is that\\u00a0\\u00a0they're afraid it will never change because that's\\u00a0\\njust who they are. So they often say things like,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, \\\"I want to be less anxious, but maybe\\u00a0\\nthat's just how I'm wired,\\\" or \\\"My grandmother\\u00a0\\u00a0was anxious; my mom was anxious; maybe I'm just\\u00a0\\nborn anxious too.\\\" Or my personal favorite:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"I've always been an anxious person.\", \"So\\u00a0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0and while there is always the chance that the\\u00a0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\u00a0\\u00a0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\u00a0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\u00a0\\u00a0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\u00a0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\u00a0\\u00a0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\u00a0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\u00a0\\u00a0then you need to spend some time figuring\\u00a0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\u00a0\\u00a0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\u00a0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\u00a0\\u00a0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\u00a0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\u00a0\\u00a0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\u00a0\\nIs it kindness?  Is it love?  Is it education?\\u00a0\\u00a0Is it a kickbutt invention?  or Is it a happy\\u00a0\\nfamily?  When you take the time to step back\\u00a0\\u00a0and look at what you really value, then it makes it\\u00a0\\nworthwhile to face your fears, accept the \\\"what ifs\\\",\\u00a0\\u00a0take courage, and boldly move forward.

Wichtig ist auch, sich auf Ihre Werte und Ziele im Leben zu konzentrieren, anstatt von der Angst bestimmt zu werden.\", \"context\": [\"In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\u00a0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\u00a0\\u00a0Second, you judge that feeling to\\u00a0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Then this triggers an escalating\\u00a0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\u00a0\\nSo let's take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\u00a0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\u00a0\\u00a0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\u00a0\\nattacks: \\\"It would be disastrous if I had\\u00a0\\u00a0a panic attack.\\\" \\\"It would be awful if my anxiety\\u00a0\\ntakes over.\\\" \\\"What if I'm having a heart attack?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"What if I pass out?\\\" \\\"If I can just force\\u00a0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\\\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\u00a0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They're\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\u00a0\\u00a0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\u00a0\\ndoing. But they aren't physically dangerous. All\\u00a0\\u00a0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\u00a0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\u00a0\\u00a0actually makes it less likely that you'll pass\\u00a0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone's having a panic attack and they\\u00a0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\u00a0\\u00a0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\u00a0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\u00a0\\u00a0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\u00a0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\u00a0\\u00a0when you walk around, but when you move around\\u00a0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\u00a0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn't help. It's\\u00a0\\u00a0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\u00a0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\u00a0\\u00a0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\u00a0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn't,\\u00a0\\u00a0and neither is fear. Okay, now there's some\\u00a0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"But it could be a heart attack this\\u00a0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\u00a0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\u00a0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\u00a0\\u00a0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\u00a0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\u00a0\\u00a0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\u00a0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\u00a0\\u00a0that you shouldn't live your life or\\u00a0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\u00a0\\u00a0There's so much to be said about the certainty\\u00a0\\ntrap. This is, I don't have time for it in this\\u00a0\\u00a0video. I'll make another video on it. But let me\\u00a0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\u00a0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\u00a0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\u00a0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\u00a0\\u00a0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\u00a0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\u00a0\\u00a0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\u00a0\\nSo panic attacks aren't dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\u00a0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\u00a0\\u00a0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\u00a0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\u00a0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\u00a0\\u00a0you get really bad advice if you have\\u00a0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\u00a0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\\\"Look, if you've tried this and it worked,\\u00a0\\nyou wouldn't be here. This is the exact wrong\\u00a0\\u00a0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\u00a0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\u00a0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\u00a0\\u00a0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\u00a0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.\", \"So I really\\u00a0\\u00a0haven't done any leading in about six years. So that\\u00a0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\u00a0\\u00a0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\u00a0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\u00a0\\u00a0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\u00a0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\u00a0\\u00a0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\u00a0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\u00a0\\u00a0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\u00a0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\u00a0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\u00a0\\u00a0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\u00a0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\u00a0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\u00a0\\u00a0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\u00a0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\u00a0\\u00a0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\u00a0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\u00a0\\u00a0of causing harm to others. Um but I'm going to be\\u00a0\\nusing exposure therapy. I'm going to demonstrate it\\u00a0\\u00a0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\u00a0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn't work. Uh\\u00a0\\u00a0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\u00a0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\u00a0\\u00a0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\u00a0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\u00a0\\u00a0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\u00a0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\u00a0\\u00a0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\u00a0\\nit still bothered you um you didn't continue. so my\\u00a0\\u00a0problem with fear of falling is I just haven't\\u00a0\\npracticed it enough, and it's been a long time\\u00a0\\u00a0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\u00a0\\nit's naturally plastic. It's naturally adaptable.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\u00a0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\u00a0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0germs more, so they developed greater health\\u00a0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\u00a0\\u00a0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\u00a0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it's\\u00a0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\u00a0\\u00a0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\u00a0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\u00a0\\u00a0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\u00a0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\u00a0\\u00a0about this is as you work the process, you build\\u00a0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\u00a0\\u00a0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\u00a0\\nthat you once feared. So let's test it out. Here's\\u00a0\\u00a0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\u00a0\\nUm I'm going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\u00a0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\u00a0\\u00a0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\u00a0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it's,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\u00a0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\u00a0\\u00a0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\u00a0\\nthere's something out there that you care about\\u00a0\\u00a0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\u00a0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\u00a0\\u00a0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\u00a0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\u00a0\\u00a0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\u00a0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\u00a0\\u00a0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\u00a0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\u00a0\\u00a0like let's say if you're afraid of dogs you might\\u00a0\\nsay like, \\\"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\u00a0\\u00a0a dog in their home. It's going to be wonderful\\u00a0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\u00a0\\u00a0home.\\\" And and visualize how great that'll be. So my\\u00a0\\ngoal: I want to get really good at falling so that\\u00a0\\u00a0I can lead climb up really cool routes.\", \"panic attacks are a different beast altogether\\u00a0\\nif you've only ever had one panic attack or just a\\u00a0\\u00a0handful you can try any of these previous\\u00a0\\ntechniques that you want give them a try\\u00a0\\u00a0just experiment see if they work but if you\\u00a0\\nget repeated panic attacks then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he says i once overheard a man in a stall\\u00a0\\nnext to me whispered to himself please not now[Applause]yeah now jimmy makes a great joke of it but\\u00a0\\ni can almost guarantee that it was someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because acceptance has to come\\u00a0\\nbefore change and the technique is a little\\u00a0\\u00a0bit paradoxical so in the next video we're\\u00a0\\ngoing to talk about how the panic cycle works\\u00a0\\u00a0and in the last video we're going to go way in\\u00a0\\ndepth on how to stop recurring panic attacks[Music] you\", \"panikattacken sind pl\\u00f6tzlich\\neinschlie\\u00dfende

f\\u00fcr meine wiederkehrenden Angstzust\\u00e4nde und Panikattacken sein?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\u00a0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\u00a0\\u00a0Second, you judge that feeling to\\u00a0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Then this triggers an escalating\\u00a0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\u00a0\\nSo let's take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\u00a0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\u00a0\\u00a0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\u00a0\\nattacks: \\\"It would be disastrous if I had\\u00a0\\u00a0a panic attack.\\\" \\\"It would be awful if my anxiety\\u00a0\\ntakes over.\\\" \\\"What if I'm having a heart attack?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"What if I pass out?\\\" \\\"If I can just force\\u00a0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\\\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\u00a0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They're\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\u00a0\\u00a0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\u00a0\\ndoing. But they aren't physically dangerous. All\\u00a0\\u00a0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\u00a0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\u00a0\\u00a0actually makes it less likely that you'll pass\\u00a0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone's having a panic attack and they\\u00a0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\u00a0\\u00a0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\u00a0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\u00a0\\u00a0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\u00a0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\u00a0\\u00a0when you walk around, but when you move around\\u00a0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\u00a0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn't help. It's\\u00a0\\u00a0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\u00a0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\u00a0\\u00a0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\u00a0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn't,\\u00a0\\u00a0and neither is fear. Okay, now there's some\\u00a0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"But it could be a heart attack this\\u00a0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\u00a0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\u00a0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\u00a0\\u00a0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\u00a0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\u00a0\\u00a0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\u00a0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\u00a0\\u00a0that you shouldn't live your life or\\u00a0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\u00a0\\u00a0There's so much to be said about the certainty\\u00a0\\ntrap. This is, I don't have time for it in this\\u00a0\\u00a0video. I'll make another video on it. But let me\\u00a0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\u00a0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\u00a0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\u00a0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\u00a0\\u00a0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\u00a0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\u00a0\\u00a0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\u00a0\\nSo panic attacks aren't dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\u00a0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\u00a0\\u00a0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\u00a0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\u00a0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\u00a0\\u00a0you get really bad advice if you have\\u00a0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\u00a0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\\\"Look, if you've tried this and it worked,\\u00a0\\nyou wouldn't be here. This is the exact wrong\\u00a0\\u00a0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\u00a0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\u00a0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\u00a0\\u00a0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\u00a0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.\", \"So I really\\u00a0\\u00a0haven't done any leading in about six years. So that\\u00a0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\u00a0\\u00a0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\u00a0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\u00a0\\u00a0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\u00a0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\u00a0\\u00a0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\u00a0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\u00a0\\u00a0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\u00a0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\u00a0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\u00a0\\u00a0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\u00a0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\u00a0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\u00a0\\u00a0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\u00a0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\u00a0\\u00a0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\u00a0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\u00a0\\u00a0of causing harm to others. Um but I'm going to be\\u00a0\\nusing exposure therapy. I'm going to demonstrate it\\u00a0\\u00a0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\u00a0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn't work. Uh\\u00a0\\u00a0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\u00a0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\u00a0\\u00a0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\u00a0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\u00a0\\u00a0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\u00a0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\u00a0\\u00a0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\u00a0\\nit still bothered you um you didn't continue. so my\\u00a0\\u00a0problem with fear of falling is I just haven't\\u00a0\\npracticed it enough, and it's been a long time\\u00a0\\u00a0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\u00a0\\nit's naturally plastic. It's naturally adaptable.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\u00a0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\u00a0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0germs more, so they developed greater health\\u00a0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\u00a0\\u00a0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\u00a0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it's\\u00a0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\u00a0\\u00a0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\u00a0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\u00a0\\u00a0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\u00a0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\u00a0\\u00a0about this is as you work the process, you build\\u00a0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\u00a0\\u00a0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\u00a0\\nthat you once feared. So let's test it out. Here's\\u00a0\\u00a0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\u00a0\\nUm I'm going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\u00a0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\u00a0\\u00a0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\u00a0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it's,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\u00a0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\u00a0\\u00a0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\u00a0\\nthere's something out there that you care about\\u00a0\\u00a0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\u00a0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\u00a0\\u00a0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\u00a0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\u00a0\\u00a0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\u00a0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\u00a0\\u00a0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\u00a0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\u00a0\\u00a0like let's say if you're afraid of dogs you might\\u00a0\\nsay like, \\\"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\u00a0\\u00a0a dog in their home. It's going to be wonderful\\u00a0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\u00a0\\u00a0home.\\\" And and visualize how great that'll be. So my\\u00a0\\ngoal: I want to get really good at falling so that\\u00a0\\u00a0I can lead climb up really cool routes.\", \"panic attacks are a different beast altogether\\u00a0\\nif you've only ever had one panic attack or just a\\u00a0\\u00a0handful you can try any of these previous\\u00a0\\ntechniques that you want give them a try\\u00a0\\u00a0just experiment see if they work but if you\\u00a0\\nget repeated panic attacks then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he says i once overheard a man in a stall\\u00a0\\nnext to me whispered to himself please not now[Applause]yeah now jimmy makes a great joke of it but\\u00a0\\ni can almost guarantee that it was someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because acceptance has to come\\u00a0\\nbefore change and the technique is a little\\u00a0\\u00a0bit paradoxical so in the next video we're\\u00a0\\ngoing to talk about how the panic cycle

Your situation is actually safe.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, if there is something in your\\u00a0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\u00a0\\u00a0that's not actually safe - like a\\u00a0\\nrattlesnake, let's say - get out of your head,\\u00a0\\u00a0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\u00a0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\u00a0\\nthose feelings.

It's\\u00a0\\nsaying, \\\"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\\\" It's\\u00a0\\nany sentence starting with \\\"what if.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0It's saying, \\\"I can't handle feeling this\\u00a0\\nway.\\\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\u00a0\\u00a0struggling against your feelings and have more\\u00a0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\u00a0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you're experiencing.\\\"This is a panic attack. I'm not actually\\u00a0\\nin danger. I'm actually safe.\\\" Or say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\u00a0\\nyou going to tell me that I'm dying\\u00a0\\u00a0again? Nice to see you again, but you're\\u00a0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\u00a0\\ncan't stand being laughed at. If you can't laugh,\\u00a0\\u00a0just be like, \\\"Hey there, you little panic\\u00a0\\nthought. I know what you're trying to do.That's cool. But I've got some other stuff to\\u00a0\\nthink about right now.\\\" Or you say, \\\"Right now\\u00a0\\u00a0in this moment, I'm actually safe.\\\" Okay. So back\\u00a0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\u00a0\\u00a0really didn't want to feel anxious that day.\\u00a0\\nHe didn't want to get upset or emotional.\\u00a0\\u00a0But as he started to walk in, he started\\u00a0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\u00a0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\u00a0\\u00a0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\u00a0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\u00a0\\u00a0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\u00a0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\u00a0\\u00a0finally clicked for him. He said,\\u00a0\\n\\\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\u00a0\\nare just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\u00a0\\nfeel them. It's like he stopped struggling\\u00a0\\u00a0against them and just let himself ride\\u00a0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\u00a0\\u00a0And when he did, they suddenly\\u00a0\\ndidn't have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\u00a0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\u00a0\\u00a0tell me, \\\"It's working. It's actually working. My\\u00a0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\", \"In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\u00a0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\u00a0\\u00a0Second, you judge that feeling to\\u00a0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Then this triggers an escalating\\u00a0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\u00a0\\nSo let's take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\u00a0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\u00a0\\u00a0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\u00a0\\nattacks: \\\"It would be disastrous if I had\\u00a0\\u00a0a panic attack.\\\" \\\"It would be awful if my anxiety\\u00a0\\ntakes over.\\\" \\\"What if I'm having a heart attack?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"What if I pass out?\\\" \\\"If I can just force\\u00a0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\\\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\u00a0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They're\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\u00a0\\u00a0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\u00a0\\ndoing. But they aren't physically dangerous. All\\u00a0\\u00a0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\u00a0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\u00a0\\u00a0actually makes it less likely that you'll pass\\u00a0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone's having a panic attack and they\\u00a0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\u00a0\\u00a0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\u00a0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\u00a0\\u00a0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\u00a0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\u00a0\\u00a0when you walk around, but when you move around\\u00a0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\u00a0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn't help. It's\\u00a0\\u00a0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\u00a0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\u00a0\\u00a0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\u00a0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn't,\\u00a0\\u00a0and neither is fear. Okay, now there's some\\u00a0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"But it could be a heart attack this\\u00a0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\u00a0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\u00a0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\u00a0\\u00a0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\u00a0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\u00a0\\u00a0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\u00a0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\u00a0\\u00a0that you shouldn't live your life or\\u00a0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\u00a0\\u00a0There's so much to be said about the certainty\\u00a0\\ntrap. This is, I don't have time for it in this\\u00a0\\u00a0video. I'll make another video on it. But let me\\u00a0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\u00a0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\u00a0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\u00a0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\u00a0\\u00a0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\u00a0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\u00a0\\u00a0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\u00a0\\nSo panic attacks aren't dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\u00a0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\u00a0\\u00a0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\u00a0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\u00a0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\u00a0\\u00a0you get really bad advice if you have\\u00a0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\u00a0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\\\"Look, if you've tried this and it worked,\\u00a0\\nyou wouldn't be here. This is the exact wrong\\u00a0\\u00a0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\u00a0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\u00a0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\u00a0\\u00a0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\u00a0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.\", \"My\\u00a0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0And when he'd get really scared, he'd say,\\u00a0\\n\\\"I'm feeling really scared right now,\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0which is noticing the feeling and making\\u00a0\\nspace for it instead of what he used to do,\\u00a0\\u00a0which is say things like, \\\"Will I ever get better?Am I going to feel this way forever?\\u00a0\\nDoes this mean I'm losing my mind?\\\" Now,\\u00a0\\u00a0sometimes Steve still gets scared of his emotions,\\u00a0\\u00a0but in general, he's doing so much better. He's\\u00a0\\ndecreased his panic attacks by like 95%. And\\u00a0\\u00a0he's overall just doing so much better at letting\\u00a0\\nhimself feel his feelings without fighting them.Okay. Number four. Panic seems to come from\\u00a0\\nnowhere. You can't always predict when panic\\u00a0\\u00a0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\u00a0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\u00a0\\u00a0predicting when you're going to feel some anxiety\\u00a0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\u00a0\\u00a0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\u00a0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don't try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\u00a0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\u00a0\\u00a0they actually are and makes your panic or\\u00a0\\nanxiety worse. It's also important to work\\u00a0\\u00a0to decrease over-anxiety. So if you imagine\\u00a0\\nanxiety on a scale from 0 to 10, I often see\\u00a0\\u00a0panic attacks in people who are constantly running\\u00a0\\nat this baseline of like 6 or 7 on the scale,\\u00a0\\u00a0and small situations that are like a level\\u00a0\\n1 or a level 2 just pop them out of okayand into panic. So for example, someone who is\\u00a0\\nextremely stressed out with work and kids and\\u00a0\\u00a0financial problems, they might have a panic\\u00a0\\nattack from what seems like out of nowhere.\\u00a0\\u00a0But upon careful inspection, it's like everything\\u00a0\\nwas just piling up. And then the traffic and\\u00a0\\u00a0being late to pick up the kids, something\\u00a0\\nthat's not normally panic-attack worthy,that little thing just puts you over the\\u00a0\\ntop. So treating anxiety is this combination\\u00a0\\u00a0of changing your relationship with anxiety,\\u00a0\\nof accepting anxiety and making space for it,\\u00a0\\u00a0and also putting things in your life in order.\\u00a0\\u00a0So doing that groundwork to resolve your\\u00a0\\nbackground stress, that can make a big difference.Okay. So just to summarize: panic attacks are\\u00a0\\nusually anxiety about anxiety or anxiety about\\u00a0\\u00a0the physical symptoms of anxiety. They spiral\\u00a0\\nout of control when you catastrophize about these\\u00a0\\u00a0symptoms or you try to force them to go away. If\\u00a0\\nyou want to stop having repeated panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0you can learn to accept anxiety\\u00a0\\nas normal, safe, and natural.\\u00a0\\u00a0Make space for those uncomfortable situations.Don't believe your catastrophic thoughts. And\\u00a0\\ntake steps to decrease your overall anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0When you take these steps, you'll show\\u00a0\\npanic that it doesn't control your life.\\u00a0\\u00a0And over time you'll retrain your\\u00a0\\nbrain that feelings of anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0can't hurt you. And the panic attacks\\u00a0\\nwill greatly decrease or stop altogether.Okay. Hope you found this helpful.\\u00a0\\nThank you for watching, and take care.\", \"So I really\\u00a0\\u00a0haven't done any leading in about six years. So that\\u00a0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\u00a0\\u00a0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\u00a0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\u00a0\\u00a0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\u00a0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\u00a0\\u00a0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\u00a0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\u00a0\\u00a0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\u00a0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\u00a0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\u00a0\\u00a0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\u00a0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\u00a0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\u00a0\\u00a0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\u00a0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\u00a0\\u00a0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\u00a0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\u00a0\\u00a0of causing harm to others. Um but I'm going to be\\u00a0\\nusing exposure therapy. I'm going to demonstrate it\\u00a0\\u00a0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\u00a0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn't work. Uh\\u00a0\\u00a0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\u00a0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\u00a0\\u00a0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\u00a0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\u00a0\\u00a0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\u00a0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\u00a0\\u00a0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\u00a0\\nit still bothered you um you didn't continue. so my\\u00a0\\u00a0problem with fear of falling is I just haven't\\u00a0\\npracticed it enough, and it's been a long time\\u00a0\\u00a0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\u00a0\\nit's naturally plastic. It's naturally adaptable.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\u00a0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\u00a0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0germs more, so they developed greater health\\u00a0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\u00a0\\u00a0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\u00a0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it's\\u00a0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\u00a0\\u00a0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\u00a0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\u00a0\\u00a0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\u00a0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\u00a0\\u00a0about this is as you work the process, you build\\u00a0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\u00a0\\u00a0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\u00a0\\nthat you once feared. So let's test it out. Here's\\u00a0\\u00a0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\u00a0\\nUm I'm going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\u00a0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\u00a0\\u00a0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\u00a0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it's,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\u00a0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\u00a0\\u00a0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\u00a0\\nthere's something out there that you care about\\u00a0\\u00a0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\u00a0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\u00a0\\u00a0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\u00a0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\u00a0\\u00a0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\u00a0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\u00a0\\u00a0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\u00a0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\u00a0\\u00a0like let's say if you're afraid of dogs you might\\u00a0\\nsay like, \\\"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\u00a0\\u00a0a dog in their home. It's going to be wonderful\\u00a0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\u00a0\\u00a0home.\\\" And and visualize how great that'll be. So my\\u00a0\\ngoal: I want to get really good at falling so that\\u00a0\\u00a0I can lead climb up really cool routes.\", \"panic attacks are a different beast altogether\\u00a0\\nif you've only ever had one panic attack or just a\\u00a0\\u00a0handful you can try any of these previous\\u00a0\\ntechniques that you want give them a try\\u00a0\\u00a0just experiment see if they work but if you\\u00a0\\nget repeated panic attacks then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he says i once overheard a man in a stall\\u00a0\\nnext to me whispered to himself please not now[Applause]yeah now jimmy makes a great joke of it but\\u00a0\\ni can almost guarantee that it was someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because acceptance has to come\\u00a0\\nbefore change and the technique is a little\\u00a0\\u00a0bit paradoxical so in the next video we're\\u00a0\\ngoing to talk about how the panic cycle works\\u00a0\\u00a0and in the last video we're going to go way in\\u00a0\\ndepth on how to stop recurring panic attacks[Music] you\"], \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Wie kann ich mit meinen st\\u00e4ndig wiederkehrenden Angstzust\\u00e4nden und Panikattacken umgehen?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"I think he still felt\\u00a0\\u00a0some weird sensations, but he wasn't fighting them\\u00a0\\nanymore. And the intensity dropped by like 99%.\\u00a0\\u00a0Franklin Roosevelt said, \\\"Courage is not the\\u00a0\\nabsence of fear but rather the assessment that\\u00a0\\u00a0something is more important.\\\" It's okay to\\u00a0\\nthink or feel all sorts of panicky stuff.But that doesn't mean you have to listen to it\\u00a0\\nor believe it. This is the paradox of a panic\\u00a0\\u00a0attack. \\\"To free ourselves from panic, we need\\u00a0\\nto be willing to have it,\\\" Nick Wignall says.\\u00a0\\u00a0Remind yourself that you're actually safe. Anxiety\\u00a0\\nwon't hurt you. Your situation is actually safe.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, if there is something in your\\u00a0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\u00a0\\u00a0that's not actually safe - like a\\u00a0\\nrattlesnake, let's say - get out of your head,\\u00a0\\u00a0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\u00a0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\u00a0\\nthose feelings. Stop fighting them.\\u00a0\\u00a0I've got tons of videos on how to do this\\u00a0\\n- how to feel your feelings, willingness,\\u00a0\\u00a0how anxiety and depression are connected, and the\\u00a0\\nwillingly out of breath activity. This this skill,\\u00a0\\u00a0willingness, is a skill you can learn, to let\\u00a0\\nyourself feel your feelings without fighting them.Number three, don't believe everything you think.\\u00a0\\nThe third step to stopping future panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0is to get really good at noticing your panic\\u00a0\\nstory. So for Steve, his panic stories were,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"What if I always feel this way? What if\\u00a0\\nI never get better? What if this means I'm\\u00a0\\u00a0losing my mind?\\\" The way you tell your story\\u00a0\\nreinforces your brain's perception of danger.So you need to learn to notice\\u00a0\\nthe panic stories that you tell.\\u00a0\\u00a0And then just get good at noticing them\\u00a0\\nwithout buying them, noticing them without\\u00a0\\u00a0believing them. We talked about some of those\\u00a0\\nthoughts earlier. It's catastrophizing. It's\\u00a0\\u00a0believing you're having a heart attack. It's\\u00a0\\nsaying, \\\"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\\\" It's\\u00a0\\nany sentence starting with \\\"what if.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0It's saying, \\\"I can't handle feeling this\\u00a0\\nway.\\\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\u00a0\\u00a0struggling against your feelings and have more\\u00a0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\u00a0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you're experiencing.\\\"This is a panic attack. I'm not actually\\u00a0\\nin danger. I'm actually safe.\\\" Or say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\u00a0\\nyou going to tell me that I'm dying\\u00a0\\u00a0again? Nice to see you again, but you're\\u00a0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\u00a0\\ncan't stand being laughed at. If you can't laugh,\\u00a0\\u00a0just be like, \\\"Hey there, you little panic\\u00a0\\nthought. I know what you're trying to do.That's cool. But I've got some other stuff to\\u00a0\\nthink about right now.\\\" Or you say, \\\"Right now\\u00a0\\u00a0in this moment, I'm actually safe.\\\" Okay. So back\\u00a0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\u00a0\\u00a0really didn't want to feel anxious that day.\\u00a0\\nHe didn't want to get upset or emotional.\\u00a0\\u00a0But as he started to walk in, he started\\u00a0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\u00a0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\u00a0\\u00a0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\u00a0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\u00a0\\u00a0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\u00a0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\u00a0\\u00a0finally clicked for him. He said,\\u00a0\\n\\\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\u00a0\\nare just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\u00a0\\nfeel them. It's like he stopped struggling\\u00a0\\u00a0against them and just let himself ride\\u00a0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\u00a0\\u00a0And when he did, they suddenly\\u00a0\\ndidn't have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\u00a0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\u00a0\\u00a0tell me, \\\"It's working. It's actually working. My\\u00a0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\", \"In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\u00a0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\u00a0\\u00a0Second, you judge that feeling to\\u00a0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Then this triggers an escalating\\u00a0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\u00a0\\nSo let's take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\u00a0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\u00a0\\u00a0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\u00a0\\nattacks: \\\"It would be disastrous if I had\\u00a0\\u00a0a panic attack.\\\" \\\"It would be awful if my anxiety\\u00a0\\ntakes over.\\\" \\\"What if I'm having a heart attack?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"What if I pass out?\\\" \\\"If I can just force\\u00a0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\\\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\u00a0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They're\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\u00a0\\u00a0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\u00a0\\ndoing. But they aren't physically dangerous. All\\u00a0\\u00a0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\u00a0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\u00a0\\u00a0actually makes it less likely that you'll pass\\u00a0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone's having a panic attack and they\\u00a0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\u00a0\\u00a0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\u00a0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\u00a0\\u00a0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\u00a0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\u00a0\\u00a0when you walk around, but when you move around\\u00a0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\u00a0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn't help. It's\\u00a0\\u00a0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\u00a0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\u00a0\\u00a0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\u00a0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn't,\\u00a0\\u00a0and neither is fear. Okay, now there's some\\u00a0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"But it could be a heart attack this\\u00a0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\u00a0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\u00a0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\u00a0\\u00a0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\u00a0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\u00a0\\u00a0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\u00a0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\u00a0\\u00a0that you shouldn't live your life or\\u00a0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\u00a0\\u00a0There's so much to be said about the certainty\\u00a0\\ntrap. This is, I don't have time for it in this\\u00a0\\u00a0video. I'll make another video on it. But let me\\u00a0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\u00a0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\u00a0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\u00a0\\u00a0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\u00a0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\u00a0\\u00a0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\u00a0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\u00a0\\u00a0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\u00a0\\nSo panic attacks aren't dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\u00a0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\u00a0\\u00a0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\u00a0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\u00a0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\u00a0\\u00a0you get really bad advice if you have\\u00a0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\u00a0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\\\"Look, if you've tried this and it worked,\\u00a0\\nyou wouldn't be here. This is the exact wrong\\u00a0\\u00a0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\u00a0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\u00a0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\u00a0\\u00a0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\u00a0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.\", \"My\\u00a0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can't hurt me.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0And when he'd get really scared, he'd say,\\u00a0\\n\\\"I'm feeling really scared right now,\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0which is noticing the feeling and making\\u00a0\\nspace for it instead of what he used to do,\\u00a0\\u00a0which is say things like, \\\"Will I ever get better?Am I going to feel this way forever?\\u00a0\\nDoes this mean I'm losing my mind?\\\" Now,\\u00a0\\u00a0sometimes Steve still gets scared of his emotions,\\u00a0\\u00a0but in general, he's doing so much better. He's\\u00a0\\ndecreased his panic attacks by like 95%. And\\u00a0\\u00a0he's overall just doing so much better at letting\\u00a0\\nhimself feel his feelings without fighting them.Okay. Number four. Panic seems to come from\\u00a0\\nnowhere. You can't always predict when panic\\u00a0\\u00a0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\u00a0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\u00a0\\u00a0predicting when you're going to feel some anxiety\\u00a0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\u00a0\\u00a0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\u00a0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don't try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\u00a0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\u00a0\\u00a0they actually are and makes your panic or\\u00a0\\nanxiety worse. It's also important to work\\u00a0\\u00a0to decrease over-anxiety. So if you imagine\\u00a0\\nanxiety on a scale from 0 to 10, I often see\\u00a0\\u00a0panic attacks in people who are constantly running\\u00a0\\nat this baseline of like 6 or 7 on the scale,\\u00a0\\u00a0and small situations that are like a level\\u00a0\\n1 or a level 2 just pop them out of okayand into panic. So for example, someone who is\\u00a0\\nextremely stressed out with work and kids and\\u00a0\\u00a0financial problems, they might have a panic\\u00a0\\nattack from what seems like out of nowhere.\\u00a0\\u00a0But upon careful inspection, it's like everything\\u00a0\\nwas just piling up. And then the traffic and\\u00a0\\u00a0being late to pick up the kids, something\\u00a0\\nthat's not normally panic-attack worthy,that little thing just puts you over the\\u00a0\\ntop. So treating anxiety is this combination\\u00a0\\u00a0of changing your relationship with anxiety,\\u00a0\\nof accepting anxiety and making space for it,\\u00a0\\u00a0and also putting things in your life in order.\\u00a0\\u00a0So doing that groundwork to resolve your\\u00a0\\nbackground stress, that can make a big difference.Okay. So just to summarize: panic attacks are\\u00a0\\nusually anxiety about anxiety or anxiety about\\u00a0\\u00a0the physical symptoms of anxiety. They spiral\\u00a0\\nout of control when you catastrophize about these\\u00a0\\u00a0symptoms or you try to force them to go away. If\\u00a0\\nyou want to stop having repeated panic attacks,\\u00a0\\u00a0you can learn to accept anxiety\\u00a0\\nas normal, safe, and natural.\\u00a0\\u00a0Make space for those uncomfortable situations.Don't believe your catastrophic thoughts. And\\u00a0\\ntake steps to decrease your overall anxiety.\\u00a0\\u00a0When you take these steps, you'll show\\u00a0\\npanic that it doesn't control your life.\\u00a0\\u00a0And over time you'll retrain your\\u00a0\\nbrain that feelings of anxiety\\u00a0\\u00a0can't hurt you. And the panic attacks\\u00a0\\nwill greatly decrease or stop altogether.Okay. Hope you found this helpful.\\u00a0\\nThank you for watching, and take care.\", \"So I really\\u00a0\\u00a0haven't done any leading in about six years. So that\\u00a0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\u00a0\\u00a0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\u00a0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\u00a0\\u00a0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\u00a0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\u00a0\\u00a0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\u00a0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\u00a0\\u00a0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\u00a0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\u00a0\\u00a0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\u00a0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\u00a0\\u00a0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\u00a0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\u00a0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\u00a0\\u00a0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\u00a0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\u00a0\\u00a0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\u00a0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\u00a0\\u00a0of causing harm to others. Um but I'm going to be\\u00a0\\nusing exposure therapy. I'm going to demonstrate it\\u00a0\\u00a0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\u00a0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn't work. Uh\\u00a0\\u00a0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\u00a0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\u00a0\\u00a0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\u00a0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\u00a0\\u00a0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\u00a0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\u00a0\\u00a0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\u00a0\\nit still bothered you um you didn't continue. so my\\u00a0\\u00a0problem with fear of falling is I just haven't\\u00a0\\npracticed it enough, and it's been a long time\\u00a0\\u00a0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\u00a0\\nit's naturally plastic. It's naturally adaptable.\\u00a0\\u00a0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\u00a0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\u00a0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\u00a0\\u00a0germs more, so they developed greater health\\u00a0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\u00a0\\u00a0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\u00a0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\u00a0\\u00a0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it's\\u00a0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\u00a0\\u00a0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\u00a0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\u00a0\\u00a0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\u00a0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\u00a0\\u00a0about this is as you work the process, you build\\u00a0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\u00a0\\u00a0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\u00a0\\nthat you once feared. So let's test it out. Here's\\u00a0\\u00a0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\u00a0\\nUm I'm going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\u00a0\\u00a0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\u00a0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\u00a0\\u00a0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\u00a0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it's,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\u00a0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\u00a0\\u00a0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\u00a0\\nthere's something out there that you care about\\u00a0\\u00a0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\u00a0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\u00a0\\u00a0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\u00a0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\u00a0\\u00a0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\u00a0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\u00a0\\u00a0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\u00a0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\u00a0\\u00a0like let's say if you're afraid of dogs you might\\u00a0\\nsay like, \\\"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\u00a0\\u00a0a dog in their home. It's going to be wonderful\\u00a0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\u00a0\\u00a0home.\\\" And and visualize how great that'll be. So my\\u00a0\\ngoal: I want to get really good at falling so that\\u00a0\\u00a0I can lead climb up really cool routes.\", \"panic attacks are a different beast altogether\\u00a0\\nif you've only ever had one panic attack or just a\\u00a0\\u00a0handful you can try any of these previous\\u00a0\\ntechniques that you want give them a try\\u00a0\\u00a0just experiment see if they work but if you\\u00a0\\nget repeated panic attacks then it's likely\\u00a0\\u00a0that trying to make your panic attacks go away\\u00a0\\nis actually causing recurring panic attacks\\u00a0\\u00a0because you see panic attacks are anxiety about\\u00a0\\nanxiety they are fear of fear there's this jimmy\\u00a0\\u00a0fallon clip where they talk about something\\u00a0\\nfunny that they overheard this one's from reggie\\u00a0\\u00a0games he says i once overheard a man in a stall\\u00a0\\nnext to me whispered to himself please not now[Applause]yeah now jimmy makes a great joke of it but\\u00a0\\ni can almost guarantee that it was someone\\u00a0\\u00a0in the bathroom trying to force a panic attack\\u00a0\\nto not come on because that's the exact mindset\\u00a0\\u00a0that causes recurring panic attacks you start to\\u00a0\\nfeel some anxiety and then your body starts to\\u00a0\\u00a0produce some stress chemicals which trigger some\\u00a0\\nuncomfortable sensations like a faster heartbeat\\u00a0\\u00a0or an upset stomach and you think please\\u00a0\\nnot now i can't have this panic attack now\\u00a0\\u00a0this would be terrible and the more you try to\\u00a0\\nforce your body to calm down the more messages you\\u00a0\\u00a0send to your body that you're in danger that\\u00a0\\nanxiety and panic is dangerous and must be\\u00a0\\u00a0stopped so in this situation trying to calm\\u00a0\\ndown your body sends a message to your brain\\u00a0\\u00a0that the anxiety is actually dangerous and it\\u00a0\\nmust be avoided which makes anxiety worse for\\u00a0\\u00a0the for people with panic attacks trying to use\\u00a0\\ndeep breathing actually makes the problem worse\\u00a0\\u00a0anything you do to try to force a panic attack to\\u00a0\\ngo away makes them worse and makes them come back\\u00a0\\u00a0again stronger the next time so when you google\\u00a0\\nhow to stop a panic attack and the advice is\\u00a0\\u00a0try to take deep breaths if you have recurring\\u00a0\\npanic attacks that is probably going to make you\\u00a0\\u00a0feel worse because it's going to feed that cycle\\u00a0\\nof panic attacks you can learn to calm down but\\u00a0\\u00a0it's a paradox because acceptance has to come\\u00a0\\nbefore change and the technique is a little\\u00a0\\u00a0bit paradoxical so in the next video we're\\u00a0\\ngoing to talk about how the panic cycle works\\u00a0\\u00a0and in the last video we're going to go way in\\u00a0\\ndepth on how to stop recurring panic attacks[Music] you\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the response directly and accurately addresses the question asked without any irrelevant statements.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "evaluationCost": 0}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.7, "evaluation_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}, {"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Faithfulness", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 0.75, "reason": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output contradicts the context by suggesting that trying to suppress anxiety can worsen panic attacks, while the context emphasizes acceptance and facing fears as key in dealing with them.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "evaluationCost": 0}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.7, "evaluation_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}, {"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Contextual Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": false, "score": 0.4, "reason": "The score is 0.40 because the context provided does not directly address the input question about dealing with recurring anxiety and panic attacks, focusing instead on panic attacks, symptoms, coping mechanisms, anxiety triggers, and exposure therapy.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "evaluationCost": 0}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.7, "evaluation_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}, {"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Hallucination", "threshold": 0.7, "success": false, "score": 0.8, "reason": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks detail and does not provide a correction, despite not contradicting the context.

You can do\\u00a0\\u00a0both. Depression is a real disease. It has\\u00a0\\na combination of biological, which is your\\u00a0\\u00a0brain and your body health; psychological, how\\u00a0\\nyou think and act; and environmental causes,\\u00a0\\u00a0so that includes trauma, stress, and abuse and\\u00a0\\nsocial issues. Right? And depression is not your\\u00a0\\u00a0fault. No one wants to be depressed. No\\u00a0\\none just goes out and chooses one day,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, \\\"What I want, I want to be depressed.\\\"\\u00a0\\nRight? Blaming yourself, beating yourself up,\\u00a0\\u00a0believing that you're weak or something is\\u00a0\\nwrong with you because you have depression\\u00a0\\u00a0is not the most helpful approach. But neither is\\u00a0\\nthe single-minded and most likely incorrect belief\\u00a0\\u00a0that depression is simply caused by a chemical\\u00a0\\nimbalance, and the corresponding belief that\\u00a0\\u00a0your only option is to take medication. So both of\\u00a0\\nthese beliefs - the one side that, oh, that \\\"I'm\\u00a0\\u00a0bad weak or defective\\\" or that \\\"Brain chemistry\\u00a0\\nis causing my depression and there's nothing I\\u00a0\\u00a0can do about it\\\" - both of these are two rigid\\u00a0\\nand extreme ways of thinking that can essentially\\u00a0\\u00a0impair your ability to change the things that\\u00a0\\nyou can change to improve your depression. They\\u00a0\\u00a0make you more helpless. Depression is not your\\u00a0\\nfault, but there are some things you can do about\\u00a0\\u00a0it. So if we want to treat depression, we need a\\u00a0\\nmuch more flexible and informed way of thinking\\u00a0\\u00a0about depression and mental health in general.\\u00a0\\nThere is actually so much you can do to improve\\u00a0\\u00a0your mental health and to treat and resolve\\u00a0\\ndepression and anxiety. There are research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0treatments that are shown to be as effective\\u00a0\\nor more effective than medication. And again,\\u00a0\\u00a0there's nothing wrong with medication. It's a fine\\u00a0\\ntreatment option when you understand the pros and\\u00a0\\u00a0cons. When we're dealing with a disease that is\\u00a0\\nso impacted by how we think about it as a society\\u00a0\\u00a0and as mental health professionals, we have\\u00a0\\nto create a dialogue that empowers people. We\\u00a0\\u00a0can't reduce stigma by just teaching people that\\u00a0\\nthere's nothing they can do except to take meds.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, I also have an entire course on the mind\\u00a0\\nand body treatments that have been shown to fight\\u00a0\\u00a0depression more effectively than medication. So if\\u00a0\\nyou'd like to learn more about that just check out\\u00a0\\u00a0the link in the description. There really are\\u00a0\\nso many options for treating depression.

severe\\u00a0\\ndepression that they explore their medication\\u00a0\\u00a0options with their doctor or psychiatrist,\\u00a0\\nbut medication is not the only treatment,\\u00a0\\u00a0and it's not as effective as we've been led\\u00a0\\nto believe by the pharmaceutical companies.\\u00a0\\u00a0When you have depression, you deserve as much good\\u00a0\\ninformation and treatment options as possible.\\u00a0\\u00a0Therapy, exercise, a nutritious diet, good sleep,\\u00a0\\nand reducing stress usually get better results in\\u00a0\\u00a0the long term than only medication, and they can\\u00a0\\nbe used in conjunction with medication. You can do\\u00a0\\u00a0both. Depression is a real disease. It has\\u00a0\\na combination of biological, which is your\\u00a0\\u00a0brain and your body health; psychological, how\\u00a0\\nyou think and act; and environmental causes,\\u00a0\\u00a0so that includes trauma, stress, and abuse and\\u00a0\\nsocial issues. Right? And depression is not your\\u00a0\\u00a0fault. No one wants to be depressed. No\\u00a0\\none just goes out and chooses one day,\\u00a0\\u00a0you know, \\\"What I want, I want to be depressed.\\\"\\u00a0\\nRight? Blaming yourself, beating yourself up,\\u00a0\\u00a0believing that you're weak or something is\\u00a0\\nwrong with you because you have depression\\u00a0\\u00a0is not the most helpful approach. But neither is\\u00a0\\nthe single-minded and most likely incorrect belief\\u00a0\\u00a0that depression is simply caused by a chemical\\u00a0\\nimbalance, and the corresponding belief that\\u00a0\\u00a0your only option is to take medication. So both of\\u00a0\\nthese beliefs - the one side that, oh, that \\\"I'm\\u00a0\\u00a0bad weak or defective\\\" or that \\\"Brain chemistry\\u00a0\\nis causing my depression and there's nothing I\\u00a0\\u00a0can do about it\\\" - both of these are two rigid\\u00a0\\nand extreme ways of thinking that can essentially\\u00a0\\u00a0impair your ability to change the things that\\u00a0\\nyou can change to improve your depression. They\\u00a0\\u00a0make you more helpless. Depression is not your\\u00a0\\nfault, but there are some things you can do about\\u00a0\\u00a0it. So if we want to treat depression, we need a\\u00a0\\nmuch more flexible and informed way of thinking\\u00a0\\u00a0about depression and mental health in general.\\u00a0\\nThere is actually so much you can do to improve\\u00a0\\u00a0your mental health and to treat and resolve\\u00a0\\ndepression and anxiety. There are research-backed\\u00a0\\u00a0treatments that are shown to be as effective\\u00a0\\nor more effective than medication. And again,\\u00a0\\u00a0there's nothing wrong with medication. It's a fine\\u00a0\\ntreatment option when you understand the pros and\\u00a0\\u00a0cons. When we're dealing with a disease that is\\u00a0\\nso impacted by how we think about it as a society\\u00a0\\u00a0and as mental health professionals, we have\\u00a0\\nto create a dialogue that empowers people. We\\u00a0\\u00a0can't reduce stigma by just teaching people that\\u00a0\\nthere's nothing they can do except to take meds.\\u00a0\\u00a0Now, I also have an entire course on the mind\\u00a0\\nand body treatments that have been shown to fight\\u00a0\\u00a0depression more effectively than medication. So if\\u00a0\\nyou'd like to learn more about that just check out\\u00a0\\u00a0the link in the description. There really are\\u00a0\\nso many options for treating depression. Now,\\u00a0\\u00a0I I hope that the publicity that this study is\\u00a0\\ngetting helps us improve the conversation around\\u00a0\\u00a0depression and mental health, that it helps people\\u00a0\\nget actually informed about what the research says\\u00a0\\u00a0about depression and not just the information\\u00a0\\nthat the pharmaceutical commercials taught us\\u00a0\\u00a020 years ago.
