There is a\\xa0\\nlot you can do to influence your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0to decrease it over time, but you can't force\\xa0\\nanxiety symptoms to change in the moment, and it's\\xa0\\xa0usually harmful to try. So there's five skills for\\xa0\\nworking with anxiety about anxiety. Number one:\\xa0\\xa0remember anxiety is a feeling; it won't harm\\xa0\\nyou. Make space for anxiety, acknowledge your\\xa0\\xa0sensations, and shift your attention outside as\\xa0\\nwell. And five: uh clarify what you can and can't\\xa0\\xa0control. Okay. Making space for anxiety instead\\xa0\\nof resisting it and fearing it is a practical step\\xa0\\xa0that you can choose to take. It's an action that\\xa0\\nyou can practice until you get really good at it,\\xa0\\xa0and when you do, it opens you up to shift your\\xa0\\nfocus from anxiety to the things you really care\\xa0\\xa0about, whether it's the people around you, the\\xa0\\npresentation you need to give, or just being\\xa0\\xa0a kind and connected human. Okay. Thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, thanks for being here, and take care.[Music]\", 'So\\xa0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\xa0\\xa0and while there is always the chance that the\\xa0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\xa0\\xa0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\xa0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\xa0\\xa0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\xa0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\xa0\\xa0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\xa0\\xa0then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\xa0\\xa0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\xa0\\xa0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\xa0\\xa0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\xa0\\nIs it kindness?  Is it love?  Is it education?\\xa0\\xa0Is it a kickbutt invention?  or Is it a happy\\xa0\\nfamily?  When you take the time to step back\\xa0\\xa0and look at what you really value, then it makes it\\xa0\\nworthwhile to face your fears, accept the \"what ifs\",\\xa0\\xa0take courage, and boldly move forward.  I know\\xa0\\nthat facing your anxiety can be scary, but in\\xa0\\xa0the long run it\\'s worthwhile and as you\\xa0\\ndo it your anxiety is going to decrease. \\xa0\\xa0Hope you found this video helpful, thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, and take care.

So over time, for\\xa0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\xa0\\xa0and chronic stress is associated with a\\xa0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\xa0\\xa0but here\\'s the thing, the key insight about\\xa0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\xa0\\xa0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\xa0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\xa0\\xa0this only makes you more anxious because you\\'re\\xa0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\xa0\\xa0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\xa0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\xa0\\xa0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\xa0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\xa0\\xa0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\xa0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\xa0\\xa0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\xa0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Here\\'s the problem with coping skills: they\\xa0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\xa0\\xa0long-term suffering. For example, let\\'s say\\xa0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\xa0\\xa0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\xa0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Now, that might help distract you from the\\xa0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\xa0\\xa0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\xa0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0you\\'re teaching your brain that it\\'s not okay\\xa0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\xa0\\xa0that the next time you feel anxious you\\'re going\\xa0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\xa0\\xa0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\xa0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\xa0\\xa0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn\\'t\\xa0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\xa0\\xa0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\xa0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\xa0\\xa0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\xa0\\nYou\\'re training your brain to fear fear itself,\\xa0\\xa0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\xa0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\xa0\\xa0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\xa0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\xa0\\xa0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\xa0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\xa0\\xa0afraid. Or maybe you watched someone else who was\\xa0\\nnervous and afraid being shamed by someone for it,\\xa0\\xa0like one parent who is constantly mocked or\\xa0\\ncriticized for their timidness or fear by the\\xa0\\xa0other parent. Whatever the origins of this belief,\\xa0\\nit can be a surprisingly hard thing to shake,\\xa0\\xa0because while many people can acknowledge\\xa0\\nintellectually that feeling anxious isn\\'t\\xa0\\xa0actually a sign of weakness, they still feel that\\xa0\\nway experientially, especially in the moment.\\xa0\\xa0So for example, let\\'s say you just gave a big\\xa0\\npresentation at work but you got really anxious\\xa0\\xa0at one point during the presentation,\\xa0\\nand you mixed up some key information\\xa0\\xa0as a result. You spend the rest of the\\xa0\\nday ruminating and worrying about it,\\xa0\\xa0saying things to yourself like, \"That was\\xa0\\nreally stupid that I mixed those clients up\\xa0\\xa0and I got so muddled about it. I can\\'t believe I\\xa0\\ngot so flustered. Why can\\'t I be more confident\\xa0\\xa0like the rest of them? I\\'m sure now that they\\xa0\\nthink I\\'m unreliable because this is the second\\xa0\\xa0time in a week that I\\'ve gotten visibly frustrated\\xa0\\nand anxious in front of the team.\" So even though\\xa0\\xa0intellectually you wouldn\\'t say, probably, that\\xa0\\nanxiety is a sign of weakness, your self-talk\\xa0\\xa0suggests that in the moment you feel otherwise.\\xa0\\nAnd if that\\'s how you respond to anxiety, with\\xa0\\xa0tons of worry and negative self-talk, that\\'s what\\xa0\\nyour brain is going to continue to believe - that\\xa0\\xa0having anxiety is a weakness. Myth number five:\\xa0\\nanxiety is just something you\\'re born with.\\xa0\\xa0One of the most common things I hear from\\xa0\\npeople who want to be less anxious is that\\xa0\\xa0they\\'re afraid it will never change because that\\'s\\xa0\\njust who they are. So they often say things like,\\xa0\\xa0you know, \"I want to be less anxious, but maybe\\xa0\\nthat\\'s just how I\\'m wired,\" or \"My grandmother\\xa0\\xa0was anxious; my mom was anxious; maybe I\\'m just\\xa0\\nborn anxious too.\" Or my personal favorite:\\xa0\\xa0\"I\\'ve always been an anxious person.', 'As\\xa0\\nalways, okay, so we start with that baseline.\\xa0\\xa0If we\\'re working to treat anxiety, start with that\\xa0\\nbaseline of taking care of your body and trying to\\xa0\\xa0get your body healthy, trying to get enough\\xa0\\nsleep, trying to get enough light exposure,\\xa0\\xa0trying to have health in other areas of your life\\xa0\\nlike your social life. Okay, so then let\\'s just\\xa0\\xa0talk specifically about agoraphobia. So when we\\xa0\\nhave a phobia, when we\\'re afraid of a specific\\xa0\\xa0thing, um like leaving the house, or when\\xa0\\nwe are afraid of - with health anxiety\\xa0\\xa0we\\'re afraid of um like what if something\\'s the\\xa0\\nmatter? What if I am sick and I don\\'t know it?\\xa0\\xa0What if this symptom is a sign that I have this\\xa0\\nterrible disease, right? And then with social\\xa0\\xa0anxiety the fear is like \"Oh, what if people are\\xa0\\njudging me? What if I mess up? What if Ii blush?\"\\xa0\\xa0So then the thing we do that makes it\\xa0\\nworse is we try to make it go away.\\xa0\\xa0We try not to feel anxious. We try to force\\xa0\\nourselves to not feel social anxiety. Or\\xa0\\xa0we obsess about that disorder like \"Oh what\\xa0\\nwhat is this symptom going on inside of me?\\xa0\\xa0And um so like like someone with health anxiety,\\xa0\\nthey\\'re gonna obsess about this symptom. Like \"Oh,\\xa0\\xa0my stomach hurts; does that mean I have this\\xa0\\nxyz horrible disease?\" Right? With agoraphobia\\xa0\\xa0people are gonna worry about like \"What if I\\xa0\\ngo outside and feel anxious? What if I leave my\\xa0\\xa0house and feel anxious? This could be horrible;\\xa0\\nthis could be catastrophizing - uh this could\\xa0\\xa0be a catastrophe.\" So with agoraphobia, when you\\xa0\\navoid going outside or when you make these rules\\xa0\\xa0where you\\'re trying to control the anxiety,\\xa0\\nyou\\'re trying to say \"I can only go outside\\xa0\\xa0if I don\\'t feel anxious,\" then that basically\\xa0\\ntells your brain that anxiety is dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0And the new problem is not going outside, but\\xa0\\nthe new problem is your brain has determined that\\xa0\\xa0you - like now anxiety is the real danger, and\\xa0\\nI need to avoid anxiety by not doing things that\\xa0\\xa0are scary. And then that tells your brain to make\\xa0\\nyourself more anxious about that situation, and um\\xa0\\xa0then you feel more anxiety about it.\\xa0\\nAnd it creates this spiral, this cycle.\\xa0\\xa0So you - so the first thing with all three\\xa0\\nof those - social anxiety, agoraphobia,\\xa0\\xa0health anxieties - look for how are you\\xa0\\ntrying to control the anxiety? Or how are\\xa0\\xa0you trying to avoid the anxiety? And that\\xa0\\nbasically puts you into a power struggle\\xa0\\xa0with - um it puts you into a power struggle with\\xa0\\nyour anxiety. And the way fear works - anxiety\\xa0\\xa0is a type of fear - the way fear works is the\\xa0\\nmore you fight it, the more power it has. So\\xa0\\xa0to drop that struggle, there are two\\xa0\\nimportant steps. And this is big picture,\\xa0\\xa0right? Big picture, two important steps: choose\\xa0\\nsomething that\\'s more important to you than\\xa0\\xa0the anxiety. Like right now your whole life has\\xa0\\nbecome about anxiety. You\\'re not leaving your\\xa0\\xa0house because you don\\'t want to feel anxious. You\\xa0\\nare obsessively checking the internet about your\\xa0\\xa0health because you don\\'t want to feel worried that\\xa0\\nsomething\\'s the matter with you. You avoid social\\xa0\\xa0situations because you\\'re afraid you might feel\\xa0\\nanxious in a social situation, right? Your whole\\xa0\\xa0life has become sucked into like trying not to\\xa0\\nfeel anxious, and that is making you more anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So choose something more important to you. What\\'s\\xa0\\nmore important than anxiety? Is it that you care\\xa0\\xa0about people? Is it that you want to connect with\\xa0\\npeople? Is it that you have kids that you want to\\xa0\\xa0be giving your attention to instead of spending\\xa0\\nhours on the internet looking up symptoms?\\xa0\\xa0Right? So the first step with anxiety is saying\\xa0\\n\"Okay, I have been focusing so much on trying\\xa0\\xa0to control my anxiety that I\\'ve lost track\\xa0\\nof my life, like I don\\'t know what my life\\xa0\\xa0is about anymore. It\\'s only about avoiding\\xa0\\nanxiety, which is making me very anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So values, values, values, right? This is\\xa0\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy. But it\\'s\\xa0\\xa0like, what\\'s more important to you? Why are you\\xa0\\nwilling to feel some anxiety?', \"When it comes\\xa0\\ndown to it, it's recommended that you work with\\xa0\\xa0an individualized provider like your therapist\\xa0\\nor doctor when your anxiety is interfering with\\xa0\\xa0your work, your relationships, or other parts of\\xa0\\nyour life, when it's hard to control your worry\\xa0\\xa0or fears or if you have suicidal thoughts. Now, if\\xa0\\nyou don't have the skills to manage your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0the symptoms of anxiety usually don't just go\\xa0\\naway on their own, and it's easier to treat\\xa0\\xa0anxiety sooner rather than later. So of course I\\xa0\\nencourage you to work with an individual provider,\\xa0\\xa0and I also know that the skills in this course\\xa0\\nare going to help you too. Okay. For those of\\xa0\\xa0you in the full course, make sure to take time,\\xa0\\ncheck out the workbook, and um explore how these\\xa0\\xa0labels are helpful and not helpful for you.\\xa0\\nOkay.

            "  - retrieval context: [\"sort of way. There is a\\xa0\\nlot you can do to influence your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0to decrease it over time, but you can't force\\xa0\\nanxiety symptoms to change in the moment, and it's\\xa0\\xa0usually harmful to try. So there's five skills for\\xa0\\nworking with anxiety about anxiety. Number one:\\xa0\\xa0remember anxiety is a feeling; it won't harm\\xa0\\nyou. Make space for anxiety, acknowledge your\\xa0\\xa0sensations, and shift your attention outside as\\xa0\\nwell. And five: uh clarify what you can and can't\\xa0\\xa0control. Okay. Making space for anxiety instead\\xa0\\nof resisting it and fearing it is a practical step\\xa0\\xa0that you can choose to take. It's an action that\\xa0\\nyou can practice until you get really good at it,\\xa0\\xa0and when you do, it opens you up to shift your\\xa0\\nfocus from anxiety to the things you really care\\xa0\\xa0about, whether it's the people around you, the\\xa0\\npresentation you need to give, or just being\\xa0\\xa0a kind and connected human. Okay. Thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, thanks for being here, and take care.[Music]\", 'So\\xa0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\xa0\\xa0and while there is always the chance that the\\xa0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\xa0\\xa0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\xa0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\xa0\\xa0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\xa0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\xa0\\xa0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\xa0\\xa0then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\xa0\\xa0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\xa0\\xa0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\xa0\\xa0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\xa0\\nIs it kindness?  Is it love?  Is it education?\\xa0\\xa0Is it a kickbutt invention?  or Is it a happy\\xa0\\nfamily?  When you take the time to step back\\xa0\\xa0and look at what you really value, then it makes it\\xa0\\nworthwhile to face your fears, accept the \"what ifs\",\\xa0\\xa0take courage, and boldly move forward.  I know\\xa0\\nthat facing your anxiety can be scary, but in\\xa0\\xa0the long run it\\'s worthwhile and as you\\xa0\\ndo it your anxiety is going to decrease. \\xa0\\xa0Hope you found this video helpful, thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, and take care.  If you appreciate mental\\xa0\\xa0health skills in concise little packages, please\\xa0\\nconsider supporting this channel on Patreon.', 'Of course,\\xa0\\nthat doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t indirect effects\\xa0\\xa0associated with anxiety. So over time, for\\xa0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\xa0\\xa0and chronic stress is associated with a\\xa0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\xa0\\xa0but here\\'s the thing, the key insight about\\xa0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\xa0\\xa0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\xa0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\xa0\\xa0this only makes you more anxious because you\\'re\\xa0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\xa0\\xa0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\xa0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\xa0\\xa0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\xa0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\xa0\\xa0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\xa0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\xa0\\xa0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\xa0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Here\\'s the problem with coping skills: they\\xa0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\xa0\\xa0long-term suffering. For example, let\\'s say\\xa0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\xa0\\xa0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\xa0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Now, that might help distract you from the\\xa0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\xa0\\xa0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\xa0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0you\\'re teaching your brain that it\\'s not okay\\xa0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\xa0\\xa0that the next time you feel anxious you\\'re going\\xa0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\xa0\\xa0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\xa0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\xa0\\xa0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn\\'t\\xa0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\xa0\\xa0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\xa0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\xa0\\xa0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\xa0\\nYou\\'re training your brain to fear fear itself,\\xa0\\xa0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\xa0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\xa0\\xa0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\xa0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\xa0\\xa0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\xa0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\xa0\\xa0afraid. Or maybe you watched someone else who was\\xa0\\nnervous and afraid being shamed by someone for it,\\xa0\\xa0like one parent who is constantly mocked or\\xa0\\ncriticized for their timidness or fear by the\\xa0\\xa0other parent. Whatever the origins of this belief,\\xa0\\nit can be a surprisingly hard thing to shake,\\xa0\\xa0because while many people can acknowledge\\xa0\\nintellectually that feeling anxious isn\\'t\\xa0\\xa0actually a sign of weakness, they still feel that\\xa0\\nway experientially, especially in the moment.\\xa0\\xa0So for example, let\\'s say you just gave a big\\xa0\\npresentation at work but you got really anxious\\xa0\\xa0at one point during the presentation,\\xa0\\nand you mixed up some key information\\xa0\\xa0as a result. You spend the rest of the\\xa0\\nday ruminating and worrying about it,\\xa0\\xa0saying things to yourself like, \"That was\\xa0\\nreally stupid that I mixed those clients up\\xa0\\xa0and I got so muddled about it. I can\\'t believe I\\xa0\\ngot so flustered. Why can\\'t I be more confident\\xa0\\xa0like the rest of them? I\\'m sure now that they\\xa0\\nthink I\\'m unreliable because this is the second\\xa0\\xa0time in a week that I\\'ve gotten visibly frustrated\\xa0\\nand anxious in front of the team.\" So even though\\xa0\\xa0intellectually you wouldn\\'t say, probably, that\\xa0\\nanxiety is a sign of weakness, your self-talk\\xa0\\xa0suggests that in the moment you feel otherwise.\\xa0\\nAnd if that\\'s how you respond to anxiety, with\\xa0\\xa0tons of worry and negative self-talk, that\\'s what\\xa0\\nyour brain is going to continue to believe - that\\xa0\\xa0having anxiety is a weakness. Myth number five:\\xa0\\nanxiety is just something you\\'re born with.\\xa0\\xa0One of the most common things I hear from\\xa0\\npeople who want to be less anxious is that\\xa0\\xa0they\\'re afraid it will never change because that\\'s\\xa0\\njust who they are. So they often say things like,\\xa0\\xa0you know, \"I want to be less anxious, but maybe\\xa0\\nthat\\'s just how I\\'m wired,\" or \"My grandmother\\xa0\\xa0was anxious; my mom was anxious; maybe I\\'m just\\xa0\\nborn anxious too.\" Or my personal favorite:\\xa0\\xa0\"I\\'ve always been an anxious person.', 'As\\xa0\\nalways, okay, so we start with that baseline.\\xa0\\xa0If we\\'re working to treat anxiety, start with that\\xa0\\nbaseline of taking care of your body and trying to\\xa0\\xa0get your body healthy, trying to get enough\\xa0\\nsleep, trying to get enough light exposure,\\xa0\\xa0trying to have health in other areas of your life\\xa0\\nlike your social life. Okay, so then let\\'s just\\xa0\\xa0talk specifically about agoraphobia. So when we\\xa0\\nhave a phobia, when we\\'re afraid of a specific\\xa0\\xa0thing, um like leaving the house, or when\\xa0\\nwe are afraid of - with health anxiety\\xa0\\xa0we\\'re afraid of um like what if something\\'s the\\xa0\\nmatter? What if I am sick and I don\\'t know it?\\xa0\\xa0What if this symptom is a sign that I have this\\xa0\\nterrible disease, right? And then with social\\xa0\\xa0anxiety the fear is like \"Oh, what if people are\\xa0\\njudging me? What if I mess up? What if Ii blush?\"\\xa0\\xa0So then the thing we do that makes it\\xa0\\nworse is we try to make it go away.\\xa0\\xa0We try not to feel anxious. We try to force\\xa0\\nourselves to not feel social anxiety. Or\\xa0\\xa0we obsess about that disorder like \"Oh what\\xa0\\nwhat is this symptom going on inside of me?\\xa0\\xa0And um so like like someone with health anxiety,\\xa0\\nthey\\'re gonna obsess about this symptom. Like \"Oh,\\xa0\\xa0my stomach hurts; does that mean I have this\\xa0\\nxyz horrible disease?\" Right? With agoraphobia\\xa0\\xa0people are gonna worry about like \"What if I\\xa0\\ngo outside and feel anxious? What if I leave my\\xa0\\xa0house and feel anxious? This could be horrible;\\xa0\\nthis could be catastrophizing - uh this could\\xa0\\xa0be a catastrophe.\" So with agoraphobia, when you\\xa0\\navoid going outside or when you make these rules\\xa0\\xa0where you\\'re trying to control the anxiety,\\xa0\\nyou\\'re trying to say \"I can only go outside\\xa0\\xa0if I don\\'t feel anxious,\" then that basically\\xa0\\ntells your brain that anxiety is dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0And the new problem is not going outside, but\\xa0\\nthe new problem is your brain has determined that\\xa0\\xa0you - like now anxiety is the real danger, and\\xa0\\nI need to avoid anxiety by not doing things that\\xa0\\xa0are scary. And then that tells your brain to make\\xa0\\nyourself more anxious about that situation, and um\\xa0\\xa0then you feel more anxiety about it.\\xa0\\nAnd it creates this spiral, this cycle.\\xa0\\xa0So you - so the first thing with all three\\xa0\\nof those - social anxiety, agoraphobia,\\xa0\\xa0health anxieties - look for how are you\\xa0\\ntrying to control the anxiety? Or how are\\xa0\\xa0you trying to avoid the anxiety? And that\\xa0\\nbasically puts you into a power struggle\\xa0\\xa0with - um it puts you into a power struggle with\\xa0\\nyour anxiety. And the way fear works - anxiety\\xa0\\xa0is a type of fear - the way fear works is the\\xa0\\nmore you fight it, the more power it has. So\\xa0\\xa0to drop that struggle, there are two\\xa0\\nimportant steps. And this is big picture,\\xa0\\xa0right? Big picture, two important steps: choose\\xa0\\nsomething that\\'s more important to you than\\xa0\\xa0the anxiety. Like right now your whole life has\\xa0\\nbecome about anxiety. You\\'re not leaving your\\xa0\\xa0house because you don\\'t want to feel anxious. You\\xa0\\nare obsessively checking the internet about your\\xa0\\xa0health because you don\\'t want to feel worried that\\xa0\\nsomething\\'s the matter with you. You avoid social\\xa0\\xa0situations because you\\'re afraid you might feel\\xa0\\nanxious in a social situation, right? Your whole\\xa0\\xa0life has become sucked into like trying not to\\xa0\\nfeel anxious, and that is making you more anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So choose something more important to you. What\\'s\\xa0\\nmore important than anxiety? Is it that you care\\xa0\\xa0about people? Is it that you want to connect with\\xa0\\npeople? Is it that you have kids that you want to\\xa0\\xa0be giving your attention to instead of spending\\xa0\\nhours on the internet looking up symptoms?\\xa0\\xa0Right? So the first step with anxiety is saying\\xa0\\n\"Okay, I have been focusing so much on trying\\xa0\\xa0to control my anxiety that I\\'ve lost track\\xa0\\nof my life, like I don\\'t know what my life\\xa0\\xa0is about anymore. It\\'s only about avoiding\\xa0\\nanxiety, which is making me very anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So values, values, values, right? This is\\xa0\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy.

So that\\xa0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\xa0\\xa0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\xa0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\xa0\\xa0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\xa0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\xa0\\xa0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\xa0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\xa0\\xa0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\xa0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\xa0\\xa0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\xa0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\xa0\\xa0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\xa0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\xa0\\xa0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\xa0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\xa0\\xa0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\xa0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\xa0\\xa0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\xa0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\xa0\\xa0of causing harm to others. Um but I\\'m going to be\\xa0\\nusing exposure therapy. I\\'m going to demonstrate it\\xa0\\xa0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\xa0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn\\'t work. Uh\\xa0\\xa0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\xa0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\xa0\\xa0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\xa0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\xa0\\xa0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\xa0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\xa0\\xa0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\xa0\\nit still bothered you um you didn\\'t continue. so my\\xa0\\xa0problem with fear of falling is I just haven\\'t\\xa0\\npracticed it enough, and it\\'s been a long time\\xa0\\xa0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\xa0\\nit\\'s naturally plastic. It\\'s naturally adaptable.\\xa0\\xa0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\xa0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\xa0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0germs more, so they developed greater health\\xa0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\xa0\\xa0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\xa0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\xa0\\xa0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it\\'s\\xa0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\xa0\\xa0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\xa0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\xa0\\xa0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\xa0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\xa0\\xa0about this is as you work the process, you build\\xa0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\xa0\\xa0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\xa0\\nthat you once feared. So let\\'s test it out. Here\\'s\\xa0\\xa0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\xa0\\nUm I\\'m going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\xa0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\xa0\\xa0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\xa0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it\\'s,\\xa0\\xa0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\xa0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\xa0\\xa0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\xa0\\nthere\\'s something out there that you care about\\xa0\\xa0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\xa0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\xa0\\xa0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\xa0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\xa0\\xa0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\xa0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\xa0\\xa0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\xa0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\xa0\\xa0like let\\'s say if you\\'re afraid of dogs you might\\xa0\\nsay like, \"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\xa0\\xa0a dog in their home. It\\'s going to be wonderful\\xa0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\xa0\\xa0home.\" And and visualize how great that\\'ll be.

First comes a sensation or feeling.\\xa0\\xa0Second, you judge that feeling to\\xa0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Then this triggers an escalating\\xa0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\xa0\\xa0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\xa0\\nSo let\\'s take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\xa0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\xa0\\xa0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\xa0\\nattacks: \"It would be disastrous if I had\\xa0\\xa0a panic attack.\" \"It would be awful if my anxiety\\xa0\\ntakes over.\" \"What if I\\'m having a heart attack?\"\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I pass out?\" \"If I can just force\\xa0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\xa0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They\\'re\\xa0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\xa0\\xa0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\xa0\\ndoing. But they aren\\'t physically dangerous. All\\xa0\\xa0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\xa0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\xa0\\xa0actually makes it less likely that you\\'ll pass\\xa0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone\\'s having a panic attack and they\\xa0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\xa0\\xa0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\xa0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\xa0\\xa0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\xa0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\xa0\\xa0when you walk around, but when you move around\\xa0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\xa0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn\\'t help. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\xa0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\xa0\\xa0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\xa0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn\\'t,\\xa0\\xa0and neither is fear. Okay, now there\\'s some\\xa0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\xa0\\xa0\"But it could be a heart attack this\\xa0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\xa0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\"\\xa0\\xa0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\xa0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\xa0\\xa0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\xa0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\xa0\\xa0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\xa0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\xa0\\xa0that you shouldn\\'t live your life or\\xa0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\xa0\\xa0There\\'s so much to be said about the certainty\\xa0\\ntrap. This is, I don\\'t have time for it in this\\xa0\\xa0video. I\\'ll make another video on it. But let me\\xa0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\xa0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\xa0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\xa0\\xa0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\xa0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\xa0\\xa0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\xa0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\xa0\\xa0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\xa0\\nSo panic attacks aren\\'t dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\xa0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\xa0\\xa0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\xa0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\xa0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\xa0\\xa0you get really bad advice if you have\\xa0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\xa0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\"Look, if you\\'ve tried this and it worked,\\xa0\\nyou wouldn\\'t be here. This is the exact wrong\\xa0\\xa0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\xa0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\xa0\\xa0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\xa0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\xa0\\xa0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down.

Here are\\xa0\\xa0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\xa0\\nattacks: \"It would be disastrous if I had\\xa0\\xa0a panic attack.\" \"It would be awful if my anxiety\\xa0\\ntakes over.\" \"What if I\\'m having a heart attack?\"\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I pass out?\" \"If I can just force\\xa0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\xa0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They\\'re\\xa0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\xa0\\xa0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\xa0\\ndoing. But they aren\\'t physically dangerous. All\\xa0\\xa0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\xa0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\xa0\\xa0actually makes it less likely that you\\'ll pass\\xa0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone\\'s having a panic attack and they\\xa0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\xa0\\xa0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\xa0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\xa0\\xa0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\xa0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\xa0\\xa0when you walk around, but when you move around\\xa0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\xa0\\ndangerous.

And the intensity dropped by like 99%.\\xa0\\xa0Franklin Roosevelt said, \"Courage is not the\\xa0\\nabsence of fear but rather the assessment that\\xa0\\xa0something is more important.\" It\\'s okay to\\xa0\\nthink or feel all sorts of panicky stuff.But that doesn\\'t mean you have to listen to it\\xa0\\nor believe it. This is the paradox of a panic\\xa0\\xa0attack. \"To free ourselves from panic, we need\\xa0\\nto be willing to have it,\" Nick Wignall says.\\xa0\\xa0Remind yourself that you\\'re actually safe. Anxiety\\xa0\\nwon\\'t hurt you. Your situation is actually safe.\\xa0\\xa0Now, if there is something in your\\xa0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\xa0\\xa0that\\'s not actually safe - like a\\xa0\\nrattlesnake, let\\'s say - get out of your head,\\xa0\\xa0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\xa0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\xa0\\nthose feelings. Stop fighting them.\\xa0\\xa0I\\'ve got tons of videos on how to do this\\xa0\\n- how to feel your feelings, willingness,\\xa0\\xa0how anxiety and depression are connected, and the\\xa0\\nwillingly out of breath activity. This this skill,\\xa0\\xa0willingness, is a skill you can learn, to let\\xa0\\nyourself feel your feelings without fighting them.Number three, don\\'t believe everything you think.\\xa0\\nThe third step to stopping future panic attacks\\xa0\\xa0is to get really good at noticing your panic\\xa0\\nstory. So for Steve, his panic stories were,\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I always feel this way? What if\\xa0\\nI never get better? What if this means I\\'m\\xa0\\xa0losing my mind?\" The way you tell your story\\xa0\\nreinforces your brain\\'s perception of danger.So you need to learn to notice\\xa0\\nthe panic stories that you tell.\\xa0\\xa0And then just get good at noticing them\\xa0\\nwithout buying them, noticing them without\\xa0\\xa0believing them. We talked about some of those\\xa0\\nthoughts earlier. It\\'s catastrophizing. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0believing you\\'re having a heart attack. It\\'s\\xa0\\nsaying, \"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\" It\\'s\\xa0\\nany sentence starting with \"what if.\"\\xa0\\xa0It\\'s saying, \"I can\\'t handle feeling this\\xa0\\nway.\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\xa0\\xa0struggling against your feelings and have more\\xa0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\xa0\\xa0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\xa0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you\\'re experiencing.\"This is a panic attack. I\\'m not actually\\xa0\\nin danger. I\\'m actually safe.\" Or say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\xa0\\nyou going to tell me that I\\'m dying\\xa0\\xa0again? Nice to see you again, but you\\'re\\xa0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\"\\xa0\\xa0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\xa0\\ncan\\'t stand being laughed at. If you can\\'t laugh,\\xa0\\xa0just be like, \"Hey there, you little panic\\xa0\\nthought. I know what you\\'re trying to do.That\\'s cool. But I\\'ve got some other stuff to\\xa0\\nthink about right now.\" Or you say, \"Right now\\xa0\\xa0in this moment, I\\'m actually safe.\" Okay. So back\\xa0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\xa0\\xa0really didn\\'t want to feel anxious that day.\\xa0\\nHe didn\\'t want to get upset or emotional.\\xa0\\xa0But as he started to walk in, he started\\xa0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\xa0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\xa0\\xa0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\xa0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\xa0\\xa0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\xa0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\xa0\\xa0finally clicked for him. He said,\\xa0\\n\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\xa0\\nare just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\xa0\\nfeel them. It\\'s like he stopped struggling\\xa0\\xa0against them and just let himself ride\\xa0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\xa0\\xa0And when he did, they suddenly\\xa0\\ndidn\\'t have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\xa0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\xa0\\xa0tell me, \"It\\'s working. It\\'s actually working. My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"', 'In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\xa0\\nattack cycle.

He\\'s\\xa0\\ndecreased his panic attacks by like 95%. And\\xa0\\xa0he\\'s overall just doing so much better at letting\\xa0\\nhimself feel his feelings without fighting them.Okay. Number four. Panic seems to come from\\xa0\\nnowhere. You can\\'t always predict when panic\\xa0\\xa0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\xa0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\xa0\\xa0predicting when you\\'re going to feel some anxiety\\xa0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\xa0\\xa0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\xa0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don\\'t try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\xa0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\xa0\\xa0they actually are and makes your panic or\\xa0\\nanxiety worse. It\\'s also important to work\\xa0\\xa0to decrease over-anxiety. So if you imagine\\xa0\\nanxiety on a scale from 0 to 10, I often see\\xa0\\xa0panic attacks in people who are constantly running\\xa0\\nat this baseline of like 6 or 7 on the scale,\\xa0\\xa0and small situations that are like a level\\xa0\\n1 or a level 2 just pop them out of okayand into panic. So for example, someone who is\\xa0\\nextremely stressed out with work and kids and\\xa0\\xa0financial problems, they might have a panic\\xa0\\nattack from what seems like out of nowhere.\\xa0\\xa0But upon careful inspection, it\\'s like everything\\xa0\\nwas just piling up. And then the traffic and\\xa0\\xa0being late to pick up the kids, something\\xa0\\nthat\\'s not normally panic-attack worthy,that little thing just puts you over the\\xa0\\ntop. So treating anxiety is this combination\\xa0\\xa0of changing your relationship with anxiety,\\xa0\\nof accepting anxiety and making space for it,\\xa0\\xa0and also putting things in your life in order.\\xa0\\xa0So doing that groundwork to resolve your\\xa0\\nbackground stress, that can make a big difference.Okay. So just to summarize: panic attacks are\\xa0\\nusually anxiety about anxiety or anxiety about\\xa0\\xa0the physical symptoms of anxiety. They spiral\\xa0\\nout of control when you catastrophize about these\\xa0\\xa0symptoms or you try to force them to go away. If\\xa0\\nyou want to stop having repeated panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0you can learn to accept anxiety\\xa0\\nas normal, safe, and natural.\\xa0\\xa0Make space for those uncomfortable situations.Don\\'t believe your catastrophic thoughts. And\\xa0\\ntake steps to decrease your overall anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0When you take these steps, you\\'ll show\\xa0\\npanic that it doesn\\'t control your life.\\xa0\\xa0And over time you\\'ll retrain your\\xa0\\nbrain that feelings of anxiety\\xa0\\xa0can\\'t hurt you. And the panic attacks\\xa0\\nwill greatly decrease or stop altogether.Okay.

And when I got back to climbing this\\xa0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\xa0\\xa0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\xa0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\xa0\\xa0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\xa0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\xa0\\xa0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\xa0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\xa0\\xa0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\xa0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\xa0\\xa0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\xa0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\xa0\\xa0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\xa0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\xa0\\xa0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\xa0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\xa0\\xa0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\xa0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\xa0\\xa0of causing harm to others. Um but I\\'m going to be\\xa0\\nusing exposure therapy. I\\'m going to demonstrate it\\xa0\\xa0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\xa0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn\\'t work. Uh\\xa0\\xa0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\xa0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\xa0\\xa0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\xa0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\xa0\\xa0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\xa0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\xa0\\xa0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\xa0\\nit still bothered you um you didn\\'t continue. so my\\xa0\\xa0problem with fear of falling is I just haven\\'t\\xa0\\npracticed it enough, and it\\'s been a long time\\xa0\\xa0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\xa0\\nit\\'s naturally plastic. It\\'s naturally adaptable.\\xa0\\xa0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\xa0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\xa0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0germs more, so they developed greater health\\xa0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\xa0\\xa0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\xa0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\xa0\\xa0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it\\'s\\xa0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\xa0\\xa0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\xa0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\xa0\\xa0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\xa0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\xa0\\xa0about this is as you work the process, you build\\xa0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\xa0\\xa0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\xa0\\nthat you once feared. So let\\'s test it out. Here\\'s\\xa0\\xa0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\xa0\\nUm I\\'m going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\xa0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\xa0\\xa0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\xa0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it\\'s,\\xa0\\xa0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\xa0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\xa0\\xa0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\xa0\\nthere\\'s something out there that you care about\\xa0\\xa0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\xa0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\xa0\\xa0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\xa0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\xa0\\xa0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\xa0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\xa0\\xa0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\xa0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve?

And the intensity dropped by like 99%.\\xa0\\xa0Franklin Roosevelt said, \"Courage is not the\\xa0\\nabsence of fear but rather the assessment that\\xa0\\xa0something is more important.\" It\\'s okay to\\xa0\\nthink or feel all sorts of panicky stuff.But that doesn\\'t mean you have to listen to it\\xa0\\nor believe it. This is the paradox of a panic\\xa0\\xa0attack. \"To free ourselves from panic, we need\\xa0\\nto be willing to have it,\" Nick Wignall says.\\xa0\\xa0Remind yourself that you\\'re actually safe. Anxiety\\xa0\\nwon\\'t hurt you. Your situation is actually safe.\\xa0\\xa0Now, if there is something in your\\xa0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\xa0\\xa0that\\'s not actually safe - like a\\xa0\\nrattlesnake, let\\'s say - get out of your head,\\xa0\\xa0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\xa0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\xa0\\nthose feelings. Stop fighting them.\\xa0\\xa0I\\'ve got tons of videos on how to do this\\xa0\\n- how to feel your feelings, willingness,\\xa0\\xa0how anxiety and depression are connected, and the\\xa0\\nwillingly out of breath activity. This this skill,\\xa0\\xa0willingness, is a skill you can learn, to let\\xa0\\nyourself feel your feelings without fighting them.Number three, don\\'t believe everything you think.\\xa0\\nThe third step to stopping future panic attacks\\xa0\\xa0is to get really good at noticing your panic\\xa0\\nstory. So for Steve, his panic stories were,\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I always feel this way? What if\\xa0\\nI never get better? What if this means I\\'m\\xa0\\xa0losing my mind?\" The way you tell your story\\xa0\\nreinforces your brain\\'s perception of danger.So you need to learn to notice\\xa0\\nthe panic stories that you tell.\\xa0\\xa0And then just get good at noticing them\\xa0\\nwithout buying them, noticing them without\\xa0\\xa0believing them. We talked about some of those\\xa0\\nthoughts earlier. It\\'s catastrophizing. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0believing you\\'re having a heart attack. It\\'s\\xa0\\nsaying, \"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\" It\\'s\\xa0\\nany sentence starting with \"what if.\"\\xa0\\xa0It\\'s saying, \"I can\\'t handle feeling this\\xa0\\nway.\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\xa0\\xa0struggling against your feelings and have more\\xa0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\xa0\\xa0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\xa0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you\\'re experiencing.\"This is a panic attack. I\\'m not actually\\xa0\\nin danger. I\\'m actually safe.\" Or say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\xa0\\nyou going to tell me that I\\'m dying\\xa0\\xa0again? Nice to see you again, but you\\'re\\xa0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\"\\xa0\\xa0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\xa0\\ncan\\'t stand being laughed at. If you can\\'t laugh,\\xa0\\xa0just be like, \"Hey there, you little panic\\xa0\\nthought. I know what you\\'re trying to do.That\\'s cool. But I\\'ve got some other stuff to\\xa0\\nthink about right now.\" Or you say, \"Right now\\xa0\\xa0in this moment, I\\'m actually safe.\" Okay. So back\\xa0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\xa0\\xa0really didn\\'t want to feel anxious that day.\\xa0\\nHe didn\\'t want to get upset or emotional.\\xa0\\xa0But as he started to walk in, he started\\xa0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\xa0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\xa0\\xa0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\xa0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\xa0\\xa0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\xa0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\xa0\\xa0finally clicked for him. He said,\\xa0\\n\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\xa0\\nare just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\xa0\\nfeel them. It\\'s like he stopped struggling\\xa0\\xa0against them and just let himself ride\\xa0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\xa0\\xa0And when he did, they suddenly\\xa0\\ndidn\\'t have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\xa0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\xa0\\xa0tell me, \"It\\'s working. It\\'s actually working. My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"', 'In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\xa0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\xa0\\xa0Second, you judge that feeling to\\xa0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Then this triggers an escalating\\xa0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\xa0\\xa0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\xa0\\nSo let\\'s take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\xa0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\xa0\\xa0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\xa0\\nattacks: \"It would be disastrous if I had\\xa0\\xa0a panic attack.\" \"It would be awful if my anxiety\\xa0\\ntakes over.\" \"What if I\\'m having a heart attack?\"\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I pass out?\" \"If I can just force\\xa0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\xa0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They\\'re\\xa0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\xa0\\xa0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\xa0\\ndoing. But they aren\\'t physically dangerous. All\\xa0\\xa0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\xa0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\xa0\\xa0actually makes it less likely that you\\'ll pass\\xa0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone\\'s having a panic attack and they\\xa0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\xa0\\xa0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\xa0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\xa0\\xa0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\xa0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\xa0\\xa0when you walk around, but when you move around\\xa0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\xa0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn\\'t help. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\xa0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\xa0\\xa0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\xa0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn\\'t,\\xa0\\xa0and neither is fear. Okay, now there\\'s some\\xa0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\xa0\\xa0\"But it could be a heart attack this\\xa0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\xa0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\"\\xa0\\xa0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\xa0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\xa0\\xa0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\xa0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\xa0\\xa0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\xa0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\xa0\\xa0that you shouldn\\'t live your life or\\xa0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\xa0\\xa0There\\'s so much to be said about the certainty\\xa0\\ntrap. This is, I don\\'t have time for it in this\\xa0\\xa0video. I\\'ll make another video on it. But let me\\xa0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\xa0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\xa0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\xa0\\xa0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\xa0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\xa0\\xa0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\xa0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\xa0\\xa0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\xa0\\nSo panic attacks aren\\'t dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\xa0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\xa0\\xa0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\xa0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\xa0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\xa0\\xa0you get really bad advice if you have\\xa0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\xa0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\"Look, if you\\'ve tried this and it worked,\\xa0\\nyou wouldn\\'t be here. This is the exact wrong\\xa0\\xa0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\xa0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\xa0\\xa0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\xa0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\xa0\\xa0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\xa0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.', 'My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And when he\\'d get really scared, he\\'d say,\\xa0\\n\"I\\'m feeling really scared right now,\"\\xa0\\xa0which is noticing the feeling and making\\xa0\\nspace for it instead of what he used to do,\\xa0\\xa0which is say things like, \"Will I ever get better?Am I going to feel this way forever?\\xa0\\nDoes this mean I\\'m losing my mind?\" Now,\\xa0\\xa0sometimes Steve still gets scared of his emotions,\\xa0\\xa0but in general, he\\'s doing so much better. He\\'s\\xa0\\ndecreased his panic attacks by like 95%. And\\xa0\\xa0he\\'s overall just doing so much better at letting\\xa0\\nhimself feel his feelings without fighting them.Okay. Number four. Panic seems to come from\\xa0\\nnowhere. You can\\'t always predict when panic\\xa0\\xa0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\xa0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\xa0\\xa0predicting when you\\'re going to feel some anxiety\\xa0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\xa0\\xa0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\xa0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don\\'t try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\xa0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\xa0\\xa0they actually are and makes your panic or\\xa0\\nanxiety worse. It\\'s also important to work\\xa0\\xa0to decrease over-anxiety. So if you imagine\\xa0\\nanxiety on a scale from 0 to 10, I often see\\xa0\\xa0panic attacks in people who are constantly running\\xa0\\nat this baseline of like 6 or 7 on the scale,\\xa0\\xa0and small situations that are like a level\\xa0\\n1 or a level 2 just pop them out of okayand into panic. So for example, someone who is\\xa0\\nextremely stressed out with work and kids and\\xa0\\xa0financial problems, they might have a panic\\xa0\\nattack from what seems like out of nowhere.\\xa0\\xa0But upon careful inspection, it\\'s like everything\\xa0\\nwas just piling up. And then the traffic and\\xa0\\xa0being late to pick up the kids, something\\xa0\\nthat\\'s not normally panic-attack worthy,that little thing just puts you over the\\xa0\\ntop. So treating anxiety is this combination\\xa0\\xa0of changing your relationship with anxiety,\\xa0\\nof accepting anxiety and making space for it,\\xa0\\xa0and also putting things in your life in order.\\xa0\\xa0So doing that groundwork to resolve your\\xa0\\nbackground stress, that can make a big difference.Okay. So just to summarize: panic attacks are\\xa0\\nusually anxiety about anxiety or anxiety about\\xa0\\xa0the physical symptoms of anxiety. They spiral\\xa0\\nout of control when you catastrophize about these\\xa0\\xa0symptoms or you try to force them to go away. If\\xa0\\nyou want to stop having repeated panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0you can learn to accept anxiety\\xa0\\nas normal, safe, and natural.\\xa0\\xa0Make space for those uncomfortable situations.Don\\'t believe your catastrophic thoughts. And\\xa0\\ntake steps to decrease your overall anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0When you take these steps, you\\'ll show\\xa0\\npanic that it doesn\\'t control your life.\\xa0\\xa0And over time you\\'ll retrain your\\xa0\\nbrain that feelings of anxiety\\xa0\\xa0can\\'t hurt you. And the panic attacks\\xa0\\nwill greatly decrease or stop altogether.Okay.

There is a\\xa0\\nlot you can do to influence your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0to decrease it over time, but you can't force\\xa0\\nanxiety symptoms to change in the moment, and it's\\xa0\\xa0usually harmful to try. So there's five skills for\\xa0\\nworking with anxiety about anxiety. Number one:\\xa0\\xa0remember anxiety is a feeling; it won't harm\\xa0\\nyou. Make space for anxiety, acknowledge your\\xa0\\xa0sensations, and shift your attention outside as\\xa0\\nwell. And five: uh clarify what you can and can't\\xa0\\xa0control. Okay. Making space for anxiety instead\\xa0\\nof resisting it and fearing it is a practical step\\xa0\\xa0that you can choose to take. It's an action that\\xa0\\nyou can practice until you get really good at it,\\xa0\\xa0and when you do, it opens you up to shift your\\xa0\\nfocus from anxiety to the things you really care\\xa0\\xa0about, whether it's the people around you, the\\xa0\\npresentation you need to give, or just being\\xa0\\xa0a kind and connected human. Okay. Thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, thanks for being here, and take care.[Music]\", 'So\\xa0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\xa0\\xa0and while there is always the chance that the\\xa0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\xa0\\xa0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\xa0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\xa0\\xa0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\xa0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\xa0\\xa0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\xa0\\xa0then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\xa0\\xa0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\xa0\\xa0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\xa0\\xa0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\xa0\\nIs it kindness?  Is it love?  Is it education?\\xa0\\xa0Is it a kickbutt invention?  or Is it a happy\\xa0\\nfamily?  When you take the time to step back\\xa0\\xa0and look at what you really value, then it makes it\\xa0\\nworthwhile to face your fears, accept the \"what ifs\",\\xa0\\xa0take courage, and boldly move forward.  I know\\xa0\\nthat facing your anxiety can be scary, but in\\xa0\\xa0the long run it\\'s worthwhile and as you\\xa0\\ndo it your anxiety is going to decrease. \\xa0\\xa0Hope you found this video helpful, thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, and take care.  If you appreciate mental\\xa0\\xa0health skills in concise little packages, please\\xa0\\nconsider supporting this channel on Patreon.', 'Of course,\\xa0\\nthat doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t indirect effects\\xa0\\xa0associated with anxiety. So over time, for\\xa0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\xa0\\xa0and chronic stress is associated with a\\xa0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\xa0\\xa0but here\\'s the thing, the key insight about\\xa0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\xa0\\xa0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\xa0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\xa0\\xa0this only makes you more anxious because you\\'re\\xa0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\xa0\\xa0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\xa0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\xa0\\xa0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\xa0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\xa0\\xa0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\xa0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\xa0\\xa0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\xa0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Here\\'s the problem with coping skills: they\\xa0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\xa0\\xa0long-term suffering. For example, let\\'s say\\xa0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\xa0\\xa0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\xa0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Now, that might help distract you from the\\xa0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\xa0\\xa0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\xa0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0you\\'re teaching your brain that it\\'s not okay\\xa0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\xa0\\xa0that the next time you feel anxious you\\'re going\\xa0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\xa0\\xa0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\xa0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\xa0\\xa0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn\\'t\\xa0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\xa0\\xa0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\xa0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\xa0\\xa0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\xa0\\nYou\\'re training your brain to fear fear itself,\\xa0\\xa0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\xa0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\xa0\\xa0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\xa0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\xa0\\xa0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\xa0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\xa0\\xa0afraid. Or maybe you watched someone else who was\\xa0\\nnervous and afraid being shamed by someone for it,\\xa0\\xa0like one parent who is constantly mocked or\\xa0\\ncriticized for their timidness or fear by the\\xa0\\xa0other parent. Whatever the origins of this belief,\\xa0\\nit can be a surprisingly hard thing to shake,\\xa0\\xa0because while many people can acknowledge\\xa0\\nintellectually that feeling anxious isn\\'t\\xa0\\xa0actually a sign of weakness, they still feel that\\xa0\\nway experientially, especially in the moment.\\xa0\\xa0So for example, let\\'s say you just gave a big\\xa0\\npresentation at work but you got really anxious\\xa0\\xa0at one point during the presentation,\\xa0\\nand you mixed up some key information\\xa0\\xa0as a result. You spend the rest of the\\xa0\\nday ruminating and worrying about it,\\xa0\\xa0saying things to yourself like, \"That was\\xa0\\nreally stupid that I mixed those clients up\\xa0\\xa0and I got so muddled about it. I can\\'t believe I\\xa0\\ngot so flustered. Why can\\'t I be more confident\\xa0\\xa0like the rest of them? I\\'m sure now that they\\xa0\\nthink I\\'m unreliable because this is the second\\xa0\\xa0time in a week that I\\'ve gotten visibly frustrated\\xa0\\nand anxious in front of the team.\" So even though\\xa0\\xa0intellectually you wouldn\\'t say, probably, that\\xa0\\nanxiety is a sign of weakness, your self-talk\\xa0\\xa0suggests that in the moment you feel otherwise.\\xa0\\nAnd if that\\'s how you respond to anxiety, with\\xa0\\xa0tons of worry and negative self-talk, that\\'s what\\xa0\\nyour brain is going to continue to believe - that\\xa0\\xa0having anxiety is a weakness. Myth number five:\\xa0\\nanxiety is just something you\\'re born with.\\xa0\\xa0One of the most common things I hear from\\xa0\\npeople who want to be less anxious is that\\xa0\\xa0they\\'re afraid it will never change because that\\'s\\xa0\\njust who they are. So they often say things like,\\xa0\\xa0you know, \"I want to be less anxious, but maybe\\xa0\\nthat\\'s just how I\\'m wired,\" or \"My grandmother\\xa0\\xa0was anxious; my mom was anxious; maybe I\\'m just\\xa0\\nborn anxious too.\" Or my personal favorite:\\xa0\\xa0\"I\\'ve always been an anxious person.', 'As\\xa0\\nalways, okay, so we start with that baseline.\\xa0\\xa0If we\\'re working to treat anxiety, start with that\\xa0\\nbaseline of taking care of your body and trying to\\xa0\\xa0get your body healthy, trying to get enough\\xa0\\nsleep, trying to get enough light exposure,\\xa0\\xa0trying to have health in other areas of your life\\xa0\\nlike your social life. Okay, so then let\\'s just\\xa0\\xa0talk specifically about agoraphobia. So when we\\xa0\\nhave a phobia, when we\\'re afraid of a specific\\xa0\\xa0thing, um like leaving the house, or when\\xa0\\nwe are afraid of - with health anxiety\\xa0\\xa0we\\'re afraid of um like what if something\\'s the\\xa0\\nmatter? What if I am sick and I don\\'t know it?\\xa0\\xa0What if this symptom is a sign that I have this\\xa0\\nterrible disease, right? And then with social\\xa0\\xa0anxiety the fear is like \"Oh, what if people are\\xa0\\njudging me? What if I mess up? What if Ii blush?\"\\xa0\\xa0So then the thing we do that makes it\\xa0\\nworse is we try to make it go away.\\xa0\\xa0We try not to feel anxious. We try to force\\xa0\\nourselves to not feel social anxiety. Or\\xa0\\xa0we obsess about that disorder like \"Oh what\\xa0\\nwhat is this symptom going on inside of me?\\xa0\\xa0And um so like like someone with health anxiety,\\xa0\\nthey\\'re gonna obsess about this symptom. Like \"Oh,\\xa0\\xa0my stomach hurts; does that mean I have this\\xa0\\nxyz horrible disease?\" Right? With agoraphobia\\xa0\\xa0people are gonna worry about like \"What if I\\xa0\\ngo outside and feel anxious? What if I leave my\\xa0\\xa0house and feel anxious? This could be horrible;\\xa0\\nthis could be catastrophizing - uh this could\\xa0\\xa0be a catastrophe.\" So with agoraphobia, when you\\xa0\\navoid going outside or when you make these rules\\xa0\\xa0where you\\'re trying to control the anxiety,\\xa0\\nyou\\'re trying to say \"I can only go outside\\xa0\\xa0if I don\\'t feel anxious,\" then that basically\\xa0\\ntells your brain that anxiety is dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0And the new problem is not going outside, but\\xa0\\nthe new problem is your brain has determined that\\xa0\\xa0you - like now anxiety is the real danger, and\\xa0\\nI need to avoid anxiety by not doing things that\\xa0\\xa0are scary. And then that tells your brain to make\\xa0\\nyourself more anxious about that situation, and um\\xa0\\xa0then you feel more anxiety about it.\\xa0\\nAnd it creates this spiral, this cycle.\\xa0\\xa0So you - so the first thing with all three\\xa0\\nof those - social anxiety, agoraphobia,\\xa0\\xa0health anxieties - look for how are you\\xa0\\ntrying to control the anxiety? Or how are\\xa0\\xa0you trying to avoid the anxiety? And that\\xa0\\nbasically puts you into a power struggle\\xa0\\xa0with - um it puts you into a power struggle with\\xa0\\nyour anxiety. And the way fear works - anxiety\\xa0\\xa0is a type of fear - the way fear works is the\\xa0\\nmore you fight it, the more power it has. So\\xa0\\xa0to drop that struggle, there are two\\xa0\\nimportant steps. And this is big picture,\\xa0\\xa0right? Big picture, two important steps: choose\\xa0\\nsomething that\\'s more important to you than\\xa0\\xa0the anxiety. Like right now your whole life has\\xa0\\nbecome about anxiety. You\\'re not leaving your\\xa0\\xa0house because you don\\'t want to feel anxious. You\\xa0\\nare obsessively checking the internet about your\\xa0\\xa0health because you don\\'t want to feel worried that\\xa0\\nsomething\\'s the matter with you. You avoid social\\xa0\\xa0situations because you\\'re afraid you might feel\\xa0\\nanxious in a social situation, right? Your whole\\xa0\\xa0life has become sucked into like trying not to\\xa0\\nfeel anxious, and that is making you more anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So choose something more important to you. What\\'s\\xa0\\nmore important than anxiety? Is it that you care\\xa0\\xa0about people? Is it that you want to connect with\\xa0\\npeople? Is it that you have kids that you want to\\xa0\\xa0be giving your attention to instead of spending\\xa0\\nhours on the internet looking up symptoms?\\xa0\\xa0Right? So the first step with anxiety is saying\\xa0\\n\"Okay, I have been focusing so much on trying\\xa0\\xa0to control my anxiety that I\\'ve lost track\\xa0\\nof my life, like I don\\'t know what my life\\xa0\\xa0is about anymore. It\\'s only about avoiding\\xa0\\nanxiety, which is making me very anxious.\\xa0\\xa0So values, values, values, right? This is\\xa0\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy. But it\\'s\\xa0\\xa0like, what\\'s more important to you? Why are you\\xa0\\nwilling to feel some anxiety?', \"When it comes\\xa0\\ndown to it, it's recommended that you work with\\xa0\\xa0an individualized provider like your therapist\\xa0\\nor doctor when your anxiety is interfering with\\xa0\\xa0your work, your relationships, or other parts of\\xa0\\nyour life, when it's hard to control your worry\\xa0\\xa0or fears or if you have suicidal thoughts. Now, if\\xa0\\nyou don't have the skills to manage your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0the symptoms of anxiety usually don't just go\\xa0\\naway on their own, and it's easier to treat\\xa0\\xa0anxiety sooner rather than later. So of course I\\xa0\\nencourage you to work with an individual provider,\\xa0\\xa0and I also know that the skills in this course\\xa0\\nare going to help you too. Okay. For those of\\xa0\\xa0you in the full course, make sure to take time,\\xa0\\ncheck out the workbook, and um explore how these\\xa0\\xa0labels are helpful and not helpful for you.\\xa0\\nOkay. Thanks for watching, and take care.[Music]\"], retrieval_context=[\"sort of way. There is a\\xa0\\nlot you can do to influence your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0to decrease it over time, but you can't force\\xa0\\nanxiety symptoms to change in the moment, and it's\\xa0\\xa0usually harmful to try. So there's five skills for\\xa0\\nworking with anxiety about anxiety. Number one:\\xa0\\xa0remember anxiety is a feeling; it won't harm\\xa0\\nyou. Make space for anxiety, acknowledge your\\xa0\\xa0sensations, and shift your attention outside as\\xa0\\nwell. And five: uh clarify what you can and can't\\xa0\\xa0control. Okay. Making space for anxiety instead\\xa0\\nof resisting it and fearing it is a practical step\\xa0\\xa0that you can choose to take. It's an action that\\xa0\\nyou can practice until you get really good at it,\\xa0\\xa0and when you do, it opens you up to shift your\\xa0\\nfocus from anxiety to the things you really care\\xa0\\xa0about, whether it's the people around you, the\\xa0\\npresentation you need to give, or just being\\xa0\\xa0a kind and connected human. Okay. Thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, thanks for being here, and take care.[Music]\", 'So\\xa0\\nI bet, that most people doing good, feel anxiety\\xa0\\xa0and while there is always the chance that the\\xa0\\nworst may happen the the choice you make, the\\xa0\\xa0decision you make about how much risk you accept,\\xa0\\nshould be based on your values and on conscious\\xa0\\xa0risk management skills instead of just on fear, \\xa0\\nso your life is bigger, it has more meaning and\\xa0\\xa0more purpose than just avoiding fear.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take care of your life,\\xa0\\xa0then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about\\xa0\\xa0instead of just anxiety avoidance.  If you want\\xa0\\nto overcome anxiety and take control of your\\xa0\\xa0life then you need to spend some time figuring\\xa0\\nout what you want your life to be about instead.  \\xa0\\xa0What good do you want to bring to the world? \\xa0\\nIs it kindness?  Is it love?  Is it education?\\xa0\\xa0Is it a kickbutt invention?  or Is it a happy\\xa0\\nfamily?  When you take the time to step back\\xa0\\xa0and look at what you really value, then it makes it\\xa0\\nworthwhile to face your fears, accept the \"what ifs\",\\xa0\\xa0take courage, and boldly move forward.  I know\\xa0\\nthat facing your anxiety can be scary, but in\\xa0\\xa0the long run it\\'s worthwhile and as you\\xa0\\ndo it your anxiety is going to decrease. \\xa0\\xa0Hope you found this video helpful, thank you for\\xa0\\nwatching, and take care.  If you appreciate mental\\xa0\\xa0health skills in concise little packages, please\\xa0\\nconsider supporting this channel on Patreon.', 'Of course,\\xa0\\nthat doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t indirect effects\\xa0\\xa0associated with anxiety. So over time, for\\xa0\\nexample, anxiety can lead to chronic stress,\\xa0\\xa0and chronic stress is associated with a\\xa0\\nvariety of harmful, unhelpful outcomes,\\xa0\\xa0but here\\'s the thing, the key insight about\\xa0\\nanxiety that you need to know: when you worry\\xa0\\xa0about anxiety in the moment, you teach your brain\\xa0\\nto believe that anxiety itself is dangerous, and\\xa0\\xa0this only makes you more anxious because you\\'re\\xa0\\ngetting anxious about being anxious. So worrying\\xa0\\xa0about the dangers of anxiety in the moment is the\\xa0\\nvery thing that leads to the long-term anxiety\\xa0\\xa0that is associated with chronic stress and the\\xa0\\npotential risk it brings. So the best way not\\xa0\\xa0to get stuck in long-term anxiety is actually to\\xa0\\nstop worrying about your anxiety in the moment\\xa0\\xa0and be accepting of it instead. Myth number three:\\xa0\\nyou need coping skills to manage your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Here\\'s the problem with coping skills: they\\xa0\\nprovide short-term relief at the expense of\\xa0\\xa0long-term suffering. For example, let\\'s say\\xa0\\nthat whenever you feel especially anxious you\\xa0\\xa0immediately close your eyes and do a mindfulness\\xa0\\nmeditation as your way to cope with your anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0Now, that might help distract you from the\\xa0\\nanxiety or make you feel calmer and more\\xa0\\xa0relaxed in the moment, but by immediately doing\\xa0\\nsomething to try and get rid of your anxiety,\\xa0\\xa0you\\'re teaching your brain that it\\'s not okay\\xa0\\nto feel anxious, that anxiety is bad. This means\\xa0\\xa0that the next time you feel anxious you\\'re going\\xa0\\nto feel anxious about being anxious. This is the\\xa0\\xa0same dilemma we talked about in the last point,\\xa0\\ntalking about anxiety being harmful or damaging.\\xa0\\xa0So remember, anxiety feels bad, but that doesn\\'t\\xa0\\nmean it is bad. So if you immediately go around\\xa0\\xa0treating your anxiety like it is by immediately\\xa0\\ntrying to get rid of it with lots of coping\\xa0\\xa0skills, what do you think is going to happen?\\xa0\\nYou\\'re training your brain to fear fear itself,\\xa0\\xa0and that is a setup for much worse anxiety in\\xa0\\nthe long term. Myth number four: anxiety is a\\xa0\\xa0weakness. A lot of people are raised to believe\\xa0\\nthat feeling anxious is a sign of weakness.\\xa0\\xa0As a child, maybe your parents or siblings\\xa0\\ncriticized you whenever you mentioned feeling\\xa0\\xa0afraid.

So that\\xa0\\navoidance has made me more anxious about lead\\xa0\\xa0climbing. And when I got back to climbing this\\xa0\\nfall I was even like really nervous about top\\xa0\\xa0roping, which is really safe. Okay so the cool\\xa0\\nthing is science has shown us that our brains\\xa0\\xa0are really flexible. They they adapt and they\\xa0\\nchange depending on what we do. And psychology\\xa0\\xa0has developed a really effective way to naturally\\xa0\\ndecrease anxiety and fear called exposure therapy.\\xa0\\xa0So you you face your fears very very gradually\\xa0\\nand by doing so your brain learns that you\\xa0\\xa0are actually safe, and then it turns down your\\xa0\\nanxiety levels. Um exposure therapy is a research-backed\\xa0\\xa0effective treatment for phobias, which are fears of\\xa0\\nsituations; PTSD, which is fears of memories and the\\xa0\\xa0body sensations; um panic attacks, which I think are\\xa0\\nessentially fears of body sensations; and OCD, which\\xa0\\xa0are, includes a lot of different types of fears: um\\xa0\\nfears of thoughts, fears of contamination, fears\\xa0\\xa0of causing harm to others. Um but I\\'m going to be\\xa0\\nusing exposure therapy. I\\'m going to demonstrate it\\xa0\\xa0with my fear of falling. Um now you may have tried\\xa0\\nexposure therapy in the past and it didn\\'t work. Uh\\xa0\\xa0that might be for a couple of reasons. Um one, you\\xa0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\xa0\\xa0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\xa0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\xa0\\xa0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\xa0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\xa0\\xa0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\xa0\\nit still bothered you um you didn\\'t continue. so my\\xa0\\xa0problem with fear of falling is I just haven\\'t\\xa0\\npracticed it enough, and it\\'s been a long time\\xa0\\xa0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\xa0\\nit\\'s naturally plastic. It\\'s naturally adaptable.\\xa0\\xa0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\xa0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\xa0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0germs more, so they developed greater health\\xa0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\xa0\\xa0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\xa0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\xa0\\xa0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it\\'s\\xa0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\xa0\\xa0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\xa0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\xa0\\xa0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\xa0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\xa0\\xa0about this is as you work the process, you build\\xa0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\xa0\\xa0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\xa0\\nthat you once feared. So let\\'s test it out. Here\\'s\\xa0\\xa0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\xa0\\nUm I\\'m going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\xa0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\xa0\\xa0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\xa0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it\\'s,\\xa0\\xa0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\xa0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\xa0\\xa0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\xa0\\nthere\\'s something out there that you care about\\xa0\\xa0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\xa0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\xa0\\xa0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\xa0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\xa0\\xa0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\xa0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\xa0\\xa0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\xa0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\xa0\\xa0like let\\'s say if you\\'re afraid of dogs you might\\xa0\\nsay like, \"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\xa0\\xa0a dog in their home. It\\'s going to be wonderful\\xa0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\xa0\\xa0home.\" And and visualize how great that\\'ll be.

First comes a sensation or feeling.\\xa0\\xa0Second, you judge that feeling to\\xa0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Then this triggers an escalating\\xa0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\xa0\\xa0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\xa0\\nSo let\\'s take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\xa0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\xa0\\xa0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\xa0\\nattacks: \"It would be disastrous if I had\\xa0\\xa0a panic attack.\" \"It would be awful if my anxiety\\xa0\\ntakes over.\" \"What if I\\'m having a heart attack?\"\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I pass out?\" \"If I can just force\\xa0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\xa0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They\\'re\\xa0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\xa0\\xa0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\xa0\\ndoing. But they aren\\'t physically dangerous. All\\xa0\\xa0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\xa0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\xa0\\xa0actually makes it less likely that you\\'ll pass\\xa0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone\\'s having a panic attack and they\\xa0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\xa0\\xa0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\xa0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\xa0\\xa0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\xa0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\xa0\\xa0when you walk around, but when you move around\\xa0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\xa0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn\\'t help. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\xa0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\xa0\\xa0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\xa0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn\\'t,\\xa0\\xa0and neither is fear. Okay, now there\\'s some\\xa0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\xa0\\xa0\"But it could be a heart attack this\\xa0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\xa0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\"\\xa0\\xa0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\xa0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\xa0\\xa0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\xa0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\xa0\\xa0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\xa0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\xa0\\xa0that you shouldn\\'t live your life or\\xa0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\xa0\\xa0There\\'s so much to be said about the certainty\\xa0\\ntrap. This is, I don\\'t have time for it in this\\xa0\\xa0video. I\\'ll make another video on it. But let me\\xa0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\xa0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\xa0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\xa0\\xa0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\xa0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\xa0\\xa0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\xa0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\xa0\\xa0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\xa0\\nSo panic attacks aren\\'t dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\xa0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\xa0\\xa0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\xa0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\xa0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\xa0\\xa0you get really bad advice if you have\\xa0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\xa0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\"Look, if you\\'ve tried this and it worked,\\xa0\\nyou wouldn\\'t be here. This is the exact wrong\\xa0\\xa0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\xa0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\xa0\\xa0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\xa0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\xa0\\xa0fear cycle.

Um one, you\\xa0\\nmay have tried to jump into something that was too\\xa0\\xa0scary too soon, um which might have put you into\\xa0\\nthe panic zone and actually been retraumatizing,\\xa0\\xa0which reinforces that fear response in your brain.\\xa0\\nOr the other most common reason is that um you\\xa0\\xa0only faced your fear once or twice, but then when\\xa0\\nit still bothered you um you didn\\'t continue. so my\\xa0\\xa0problem with fear of falling is I just haven\\'t\\xa0\\npracticed it enough, and it\\'s been a long time\\xa0\\xa0since I did fall. Jeez! The way our brain works,\\xa0\\nit\\'s naturally plastic. It\\'s naturally adaptable.\\xa0\\xa0And the more we avoid something, the more scared we\\xa0\\nbecome of it. So during COVID a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0being around people, and a lot of people developed\\xa0\\ngreater social anxiety. Or a lot of people avoided\\xa0\\xa0germs more, so they developed greater health\\xa0\\nanxiety. The more you avoid something, the more\\xa0\\xa0scared you are of it. And the more you face\\xa0\\nsomething, the more your brain dials down that\\xa0\\xa0anxiety. So when exposure is done correctly it\\'s\\xa0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\xa0\\xa0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\xa0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\xa0\\xa0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\xa0\\ngradually work your way up. And the the cool thing\\xa0\\xa0about this is as you work the process, you build\\xa0\\nup a belief in your ability to do hard things. And\\xa0\\xa0you might even learn that you enjoy the things\\xa0\\nthat you once feared. So let\\'s test it out. Here\\'s\\xa0\\xa0how you do it. Step one: choose a fear to work on.\\xa0\\nUm I\\'m going to pick my fear of falling on lead.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. Step two: make a personal goal. So remember\\xa0\\nwhy you care about this. Focus on why it matters\\xa0\\xa0to you more than avoiding your fears, more than\\xa0\\njust living a comfortable life, um whether it\\'s,\\xa0\\xa0you know, so that you can function at your job or\\xa0\\nso you can spend more time with your loved ones or\\xa0\\xa0so that you can build up your sense of self. Like\\xa0\\nthere\\'s something out there that you care about\\xa0\\xa0more than you care about just feeling comfortable\\xa0\\nand avoiding your anxiety. So your motivation here\\xa0\\xa0is really essential to your progress. Make it super\\xa0\\nclear. Make a vision board or write your goal down\\xa0\\xa0in a place where you can see it every day. Tell\\xa0\\nothers about your goals so that they can support\\xa0\\xa0you and hold you accountable. Um imagine if you\\xa0\\novercame this fear, how will your life improve? So\\xa0\\xa0like let\\'s say if you\\'re afraid of dogs you might\\xa0\\nsay like, \"I want to visit my grandchildren who have\\xa0\\xa0a dog in their home. It\\'s going to be wonderful\\xa0\\nwhen I am able to spend time with them in their\\xa0\\xa0home.\" And and visualize how great that\\'ll be. So my\\xa0\\ngoal: I want to get really good at falling so that\\xa0\\xa0I can lead climb up really cool routes.', \"safety\\ncritical tasks\\nof course removing too much\\nresponsibility from an individual might\\nmake the job\\nboring or under-stimulating which also\\nincreases the risk of making mistakes\\nso there is a bit of a balancing act\\nhere\\nuh to be considered for employers and\\nyou also need to be able to work\\npredictably\\nand what i really mean by this is that\\nyour anxiety symptoms\\nneed to be predictable particularly\\nif\\nso panic can be uh completely\\nincapacitating for a patient in fact it\\ncan\\nincapacitate the people around the\\nindividual who drop what they're doing\\nto attend to the uh the person who is\\nhaving the panic episode\\nnow some people who experience panic\\nexperience panic\\nvery predictably there's always a clear\\ntrigger for that panic\\nwhich you can account for within the\\nworkplace you can limit\\nuh the individual's um sort of exposure\\nto that particular trigger um and if you\\ncan actually eliminate\\nand eliminate that trigger entirely and\\nthose people\\nmight not experience panic within the\\nworkplace at all\\nbut there's another group of people who\\nexperience panic\\nthrough a variety of triggers with no\\nclear pattern to it and i would be\\nreally concerned about the possibility\\nof a panic attack arising while they're\\noperating\\nuh heavy machinery uh for instance\\nit looked so extreme that they\\nhave had deep personalization or the\\nrealization element\\nnow in my experience when i've worked\\nwith people\\nwho have panic symptoms and i have\\nexpressed concerns about how that\\nimpacts their ability to do their job\\nand what they invariably tell me um\\nis when i'm operating that piece of\\nequipment\\ni'm completely fine i never have any\\npanic whatsoever\\num you know please don't take away my\\ncurrency\\nto uh operate uh that lifter\\nor to fly in an aircraft uh this is what\\ni enjoy doing\\num you know you have to allow me to keep\\ndoing that\\nand of course i can't do that you know\\nthat that would be something\\num that is uh not very sensible for me\\nto\\nto um to just give a pass for\\nand however the patient might be right\\num it might be that\\nbeing completely focused on a very\\npractical task\\num does prevent symptoms of panic it\\ndoes prevent the the sort of intrusion\\nof those worrying thoughts\\nand so my advice would be to get an\\noccupational report\\num or do a workplace assessment uh or\\nget corroborating\\neyewitness accounts of of these episodes\\nof panic from other people\\nwhich can help you as the clinician\\nto feel more confident uh to allow\\npeople to sort of re-engage in these\\nsafety critical activities\\nperhaps in a graded or supervised uh\\nmanner at the start so uh\\nsafe working and the final uh\\nheading was uh people being prevented\\nfrom working\\nat all uh through anxiety\\nuh first bullet is the same as as the\\nother ones really you're going to be\\nable to\\nwork effectively at to work at all\\nworking predictably against having very\\nfrequent and\\nunpredictable episodes of panic during\\nthe day um\\nit might be very difficult actually for\\nan\\nemployer to be able to find a working\\narrangement that\\num allows for those panic episodes and\\ncontrols them\\nwe would try uh but it would be very\\ndifficult\\num but you also have to be able to leave\\nthe house\\nif required to and travel to uh your\\nplace of work and i i think that the\\nconditions\\nof this pandemic uh seem ideally suited\\nto provoke an agoraphobic response\\nreally\\nand we are told that we're less safe out\\nof doors we're told that we're\\nparticularly unsafe\\nuh in crowded places um there is um\\nevery nation has had its own response uh\\nto controlling\\nthe um the outbreak uh and there is\\nconsiderable\\nconsiderable debate about which response\\nis correct\\nthere's a lot of uncertainty um and\\num there's a lot of things to avoid\\nreally i think um so if you consider the\\navoidance\\ncomponent of anxiety in covert related\\nanxiety\\num triggers for anxiety could be\\nanything at all\\nand being out of doors not being able to\\ngo out because you can't see\\nuh your family traveling to or from work\\ncould uh heighten your anxiety\\ninteracting with others could heighten\\nyour anxiety\\nnot having any interaction with others\\ncould heighten your anxiety that there\\nare a lot of elements\\num uh that might be included in an\\navoidance response\\num which would really substantially\\nimpair somebody's ability to work\\num and you need to be able to feel well\\nenough\\nto work so and again back to what phil\\nwas saying\\num some people will say that they just\\ndon't feel well enough to go back\", 'In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\xa0\\nattack cycle.

This is the paradox of a panic\\xa0\\xa0attack. \"To free ourselves from panic, we need\\xa0\\nto be willing to have it,\" Nick Wignall says.\\xa0\\xa0Remind yourself that you\\'re actually safe. Anxiety\\xa0\\nwon\\'t hurt you. Your situation is actually safe.\\xa0\\xa0Now, if there is something in your\\xa0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\xa0\\xa0that\\'s not actually safe - like a\\xa0\\nrattlesnake, let\\'s say - get out of your head,\\xa0\\xa0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\xa0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\xa0\\nthose feelings. Stop fighting them.\\xa0\\xa0I\\'ve got tons of videos on how to do this\\xa0\\n- how to feel your feelings, willingness,\\xa0\\xa0how anxiety and depression are connected, and the\\xa0\\nwillingly out of breath activity. This this skill,\\xa0\\xa0willingness, is a skill you can learn, to let\\xa0\\nyourself feel your feelings without fighting them.Number three, don\\'t believe everything you think.\\xa0\\nThe third step to stopping future panic attacks\\xa0\\xa0is to get really good at noticing your panic\\xa0\\nstory. So for Steve, his panic stories were,\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I always feel this way? What if\\xa0\\nI never get better? What if this means I\\'m\\xa0\\xa0losing my mind?\" The way you tell your story\\xa0\\nreinforces your brain\\'s perception of danger.So you need to learn to notice\\xa0\\nthe panic stories that you tell.\\xa0\\xa0And then just get good at noticing them\\xa0\\nwithout buying them, noticing them without\\xa0\\xa0believing them. We talked about some of those\\xa0\\nthoughts earlier. It\\'s catastrophizing. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0believing you\\'re having a heart attack. It\\'s\\xa0\\nsaying, \"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\" It\\'s\\xa0\\nany sentence starting with \"what if.\"\\xa0\\xa0It\\'s saying, \"I can\\'t handle feeling this\\xa0\\nway.\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\xa0\\xa0struggling against your feelings and have more\\xa0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\xa0\\xa0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\xa0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you\\'re experiencing.\"This is a panic attack. I\\'m not actually\\xa0\\nin danger. I\\'m actually safe.\" Or say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\xa0\\nyou going to tell me that I\\'m dying\\xa0\\xa0again? Nice to see you again, but you\\'re\\xa0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\"\\xa0\\xa0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\xa0\\ncan\\'t stand being laughed at. If you can\\'t laugh,\\xa0\\xa0just be like, \"Hey there, you little panic\\xa0\\nthought. I know what you\\'re trying to do.That\\'s cool. But I\\'ve got some other stuff to\\xa0\\nthink about right now.\" Or you say, \"Right now\\xa0\\xa0in this moment, I\\'m actually safe.\" Okay. So back\\xa0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\xa0\\xa0really didn\\'t want to feel anxious that day.\\xa0\\nHe didn\\'t want to get upset or emotional.\\xa0\\xa0But as he started to walk in, he started\\xa0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\xa0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\xa0\\xa0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\xa0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\xa0\\xa0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\xa0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\xa0\\xa0finally clicked for him. He said,\\xa0\\n\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\xa0\\nare just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\xa0\\nfeel them. It\\'s like he stopped struggling\\xa0\\xa0against them and just let himself ride\\xa0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\xa0\\xa0And when he did, they suddenly\\xa0\\ndidn\\'t have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\xa0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\xa0\\xa0tell me, \"It\\'s working. It\\'s actually working. My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings.

And then the traffic and\\xa0\\xa0being late to pick up the kids, something\\xa0\\nthat\\'s not normally panic-attack worthy,that little thing just puts you over the\\xa0\\ntop.

They spiral\\xa0\\nout of control when you catastrophize about these\\xa0\\xa0symptoms or you try to force them to go away.

So when exposure is done correctly it\\'s\\xa0\\nactually really effective at overcoming fears and\\xa0\\xa0anxieties. Exposure therapy is often most effective\\xa0\\nwhen you start with the very smallest things,\\xa0\\xa0the things that are less scary, and then you just\\xa0\\ngradually work your way up.

And the intensity dropped by like 99%.\\xa0\\xa0Franklin Roosevelt said, \"Courage is not the\\xa0\\nabsence of fear but rather the assessment that\\xa0\\xa0something is more important.\" It\\'s okay to\\xa0\\nthink or feel all sorts of panicky stuff.But that doesn\\'t mean you have to listen to it\\xa0\\nor believe it. This is the paradox of a panic\\xa0\\xa0attack. \"To free ourselves from panic, we need\\xa0\\nto be willing to have it,\" Nick Wignall says.\\xa0\\xa0Remind yourself that you\\'re actually safe. Anxiety\\xa0\\nwon\\'t hurt you. Your situation is actually safe.\\xa0\\xa0Now, if there is something in your\\xa0\\nenvironment, something physical,\\xa0\\xa0that\\'s not actually safe - like a\\xa0\\nrattlesnake, let\\'s say - get out of your head,\\xa0\\xa0stop trying to change your feelings, and\\xa0\\nactually take some action to get safe.Otherwise, make some space for\\xa0\\nthose feelings. Stop fighting them.\\xa0\\xa0I\\'ve got tons of videos on how to do this\\xa0\\n- how to feel your feelings, willingness,\\xa0\\xa0how anxiety and depression are connected, and the\\xa0\\nwillingly out of breath activity. This this skill,\\xa0\\xa0willingness, is a skill you can learn, to let\\xa0\\nyourself feel your feelings without fighting them.Number three, don\\'t believe everything you think.\\xa0\\nThe third step to stopping future panic attacks\\xa0\\xa0is to get really good at noticing your panic\\xa0\\nstory. So for Steve, his panic stories were,\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I always feel this way? What if\\xa0\\nI never get better? What if this means I\\'m\\xa0\\xa0losing my mind?\" The way you tell your story\\xa0\\nreinforces your brain\\'s perception of danger.So you need to learn to notice\\xa0\\nthe panic stories that you tell.\\xa0\\xa0And then just get good at noticing them\\xa0\\nwithout buying them, noticing them without\\xa0\\xa0believing them. We talked about some of those\\xa0\\nthoughts earlier. It\\'s catastrophizing. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0believing you\\'re having a heart attack. It\\'s\\xa0\\nsaying, \"Why does this always happen to me?This is awful. This is terrible.\" It\\'s\\xa0\\nany sentence starting with \"what if.\"\\xa0\\xa0It\\'s saying, \"I can\\'t handle feeling this\\xa0\\nway.\" Well, what are your choices? You can keep\\xa0\\xa0struggling against your feelings and have more\\xa0\\npanic attacks, or you can let yourself feel the\\xa0\\xa0anxiety and keep living your life. So recognize\\xa0\\nyour thoughts. Name what you\\'re experiencing.\"This is a panic attack. I\\'m not actually\\xa0\\nin danger. I\\'m actually safe.\" Or say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Oh, hello there, worry thoughts. Are\\xa0\\nyou going to tell me that I\\'m dying\\xa0\\xa0again? Nice to see you again, but you\\'re\\xa0\\njust a cute little catastrophic thought.\"\\xa0\\xa0Just like the boggarts in Harry Potter, fear\\xa0\\ncan\\'t stand being laughed at. If you can\\'t laugh,\\xa0\\xa0just be like, \"Hey there, you little panic\\xa0\\nthought. I know what you\\'re trying to do.That\\'s cool. But I\\'ve got some other stuff to\\xa0\\nthink about right now.\" Or you say, \"Right now\\xa0\\xa0in this moment, I\\'m actually safe.\" Okay. So back\\xa0\\nto Steve. One day Steve went to church and he\\xa0\\xa0really didn\\'t want to feel anxious that day.\\xa0\\nHe didn\\'t want to get upset or emotional.\\xa0\\xa0But as he started to walk in, he started\\xa0\\nto feel that tightness in his chest.He started to feel the anxiety\\xa0\\nbuilding up inside of him.\\xa0\\xa0And at first he tried to fight it. He tried to\\xa0\\nslow his breathing, he tried to distract himself,\\xa0\\xa0but he could feel that panic attack about to blow.\\xa0\\nAnd in that moment, about six months of therapy\\xa0\\xa0finally clicked for him. He said,\\xa0\\n\"It felt like a lightbulb clicked on,and I suddenly realized that my feelings\\xa0\\nare just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And he just opened himself up to let himself\\xa0\\nfeel them. It\\'s like he stopped struggling\\xa0\\xa0against them and just let himself ride\\xa0\\nthrough them while staying at church.\\xa0\\xa0And when he did, they suddenly\\xa0\\ndidn\\'t have power over him anymore.He stayed through the whole meeting. When he came\\xa0\\nto session the next week, he was super excited to\\xa0\\xa0tell me, \"It\\'s working. It\\'s actually working. My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"', 'In the previous video, we talked about the panic\\xa0\\nattack cycle. First comes a sensation or feeling.\\xa0\\xa0Second, you judge that feeling to\\xa0\\nbe unacceptable, bad, or dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Then this triggers an escalating\\xa0\\nfight/flight/freeze response, and your brain\\xa0\\xa0learns that panic and anxiety are dangerous.\\xa0\\nSo let\\'s take a deeper look at step two,the thoughts that transform a physical sensation\\xa0\\ninto something we interpret as dangerous. Here are\\xa0\\xa0common ways of thinking that trigger panic\\xa0\\nattacks: \"It would be disastrous if I had\\xa0\\xa0a panic attack.\" \"It would be awful if my anxiety\\xa0\\ntakes over.\" \"What if I\\'m having a heart attack?\"\\xa0\\xa0\"What if I pass out?\" \"If I can just force\\xa0\\nmyself to calm down, this will all go away.\"Why does this always happen to me? The big issue\\xa0\\nis believing that panic attacks are dangerous.\\xa0\\xa0Now, panic attacks are inconvenient. They\\'re\\xa0\\nuncomfortable. They can be embarrassing,\\xa0\\xa0or they can interfere with what you want to be\\xa0\\ndoing. But they aren\\'t physically dangerous. All\\xa0\\xa0these uncomfortable symptoms are just the body\\xa0\\ntossing you into fight/flight/freeze mode, which\\xa0\\xa0actually makes it less likely that you\\'ll pass\\xa0\\nout, stop breathing, or any of those other fears.If someone\\'s having a panic attack and they\\xa0\\ngo to the ER, an EKG will show a regular but\\xa0\\xa0rapid heartbeat. When people worry about passing\\xa0\\nout, you should know that you pass out with low\\xa0\\xa0blood pressure. A panic attack takes your\\xa0\\nblood pressure up. Heart attacks feel worse\\xa0\\xa0when you walk around, but when you move around\\xa0\\nwith a panic attack, you actually feel better.Right? So panic attacks are not actually\\xa0\\ndangerous. And our society doesn\\'t help. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0constantly talking about how bad stress is for you\\xa0\\nand how bad anxiety is for you. Now, at its root,\\xa0\\xa0stress is not dangerous for you. Chronic\\xa0\\nstress is dangerous, but stress itself isn\\'t,\\xa0\\xa0and neither is fear. Okay, now there\\'s some\\xa0\\nof you out there right now who are saying,\\xa0\\xa0\"But it could be a heart attack this\\xa0\\ntime. A panic attack could hurt you.What about this one time that I read about this\\xa0\\none thing that happened a thousand miles away?\"\\xa0\\xa0Right? Well, great. Thank you for\\xa0\\nbringing that up. That is a perfect\\xa0\\xa0example of how the anxious mind is going to\\xa0\\nhighlight the worst-case scenario and kidnap\\xa0\\xa0your emotions until you can be 1000%\\xa0\\nsure. It, this is the certainty trap,\\xa0\\xa0that you shouldn\\'t live your life or\\xa0\\ntake helpful actions until you can1000% guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen.\\xa0\\xa0There\\'s so much to be said about the certainty\\xa0\\ntrap. This is, I don\\'t have time for it in this\\xa0\\xa0video. I\\'ll make another video on it. But let me\\xa0\\nask you a pragmatic instead of logical question.\\xa0\\xa0Okay. So what if there is a one in a\\xa0\\nmillion chance that you could die? Now what?Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\xa0\\nafraid of panic attacks? Or do you want to\\xa0\\xa0choose to face life and accept uncertainty\\xa0\\nand live the life you value? Drive places.\\xa0\\xa0See your loved ones. Hold a job. You have to\\xa0\\nchoose between living a life in fear of emotions\\xa0\\xa0or a life of acceptance of emotions.\\xa0\\nSo panic attacks aren\\'t dangerous.You can choose to live a rich and meaningful life\\xa0\\neven if you have some anxiety or you experience\\xa0\\xa0the occasional panic attack. But when we\\xa0\\nfear anxiety, when we fear panic attacks,\\xa0\\xa0we feed that cycle of fear and panic. So this is\\xa0\\nwhere if you search how to stop a panic attack,\\xa0\\xa0you get really bad advice if you have\\xa0\\nchronic panic attacks. The articles all say,\\xa0\\xa0\"Try to take some deep breaths. Try to calm\\xa0\\nyourself down. Try to distract yourself.\"Look, if you\\'ve tried this and it worked,\\xa0\\nyou wouldn\\'t be here. This is the exact wrong\\xa0\\xa0advice. Stop trying to calm down your body\\xa0\\nbecause that sends a message to your brain\\xa0\\xa0that the anxiety is actually dangerous\\xa0\\nand it must be avoided. This feeds the\\xa0\\xa0fear cycle. You can learn to calm down. You\\xa0\\ncan learn to calm your body down.', 'My\\xa0\\nfeelings are just feelings. They can\\'t hurt me.\"\\xa0\\xa0And when he\\'d get really scared, he\\'d say,\\xa0\\n\"I\\'m feeling really scared right now,\"\\xa0\\xa0which is noticing the feeling and making\\xa0\\nspace for it instead of what he used to do,\\xa0\\xa0which is say things like, \"Will I ever get better?Am I going to feel this way forever?\\xa0\\nDoes this mean I\\'m losing my mind?\" Now,\\xa0\\xa0sometimes Steve still gets scared of his emotions,\\xa0\\xa0but in general, he\\'s doing so much better. He\\'s\\xa0\\ndecreased his panic attacks by like 95%. And\\xa0\\xa0he\\'s overall just doing so much better at letting\\xa0\\nhimself feel his feelings without fighting them.Okay. Number four. Panic seems to come from\\xa0\\nnowhere. You can\\'t always predict when panic\\xa0\\xa0will come, but you can prepare for it to a degree.\\xa0\\nSo learn to notice your triggers. Get better at\\xa0\\xa0predicting when you\\'re going to feel some anxiety\\xa0\\nor a physical symptom. And that way you can\\xa0\\xa0prepare yourself to use your new skills instead\\xa0\\nof trying to avoid or control your anxiety.So don\\'t try and avoid your triggers. That tells\\xa0\\nyour brain those triggers are more dangerous than\\xa0\\xa0they actually are and makes your panic or\\xa0\\nanxiety worse.

In diesem Fall kann der Arzt Antibiotika verschreiben, um die Infektion zu bekämpfen.\\n\\n- Wenn ein Kind jünger als 6 Monate ist oder starke Symptome einer Ohrenentzündung zeigt, sollte man einen Arzt aufsuchen.\\n\\nZusammengefasst werden zu Beginn schmerzlindernde Maßnahmen empfohlen.
